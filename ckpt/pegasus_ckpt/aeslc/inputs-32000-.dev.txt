I thought you would be interested in the weather forecast for the Wedding.
The data includes max temp, max temp deviation from normal (ie if max is 88 and normal max is 86 max temp deviation is +2), min temp, min temp deviation from normal and percent of precipitation.
So far things are looking good.
We are getting a cold front this weekend (hitting Texas on Monday) and looks like things should be beautiful for next weekend.
I wouldn't be that worried about the rain either - the reason the POP is so high right now is tropical moisture in the Gulf of Mexico and that will blow through this weekend.
After that the tropics settle down and it is much less likely to get tropical moisture.

Tim: I got invited to an IEP strategy session time and place noted above.
I think it will give us an important opportunity to get IEP focued on our issues, including RTO formation, repairs to the CAISO, etc.
(I doubt I will get any more of a detailed agenda for a while.)
I also think this will be an opportunity to get IEP focused on Westwide issues, or let them know we'll be using someone else for such broader issues.
I am comfortable having I or someone else from GA go but I wanted to give you the option to go too.
The other people they are inviting include both senior regulatory or commerical people including: Mr. Lynn Lednicky, Dynegy Bill Hall, Duke Jim Macias, Calpine

With the filing of the Hart-Scott-Rodino application last week, it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows.
Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift: Week of Jan 28: We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications.
The packets will contain: Key Messages Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Top Counterparty Checklist External Customer Cover Letter Password Application (PA) Registration Form Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA) Internal online Marketing Contact List Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA).
During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible.
Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site.
A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com.
This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users.
The Splash page will look something like the following: Week of Feb. 4: We will send out a mass mailing to approx.
3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site.
Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.
Week of Feb. 11: The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues).
General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
Trading/Origination Coordination The Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days.
An online marketer has been assigned as coordinator for each company and will assist each Trader/Originator in following up with Master Users as necessary to make sure PA's are signed and

This has been a tough couple of weeks.
I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.
Here's a rundown of events from last week: We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.
Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.
We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.
Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.
- The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.
The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.
The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.
As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.
Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.
Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.
Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.
All agency ratings are investment grade.
Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that: EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.
Transaction counts remain higher than average.
EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.
EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.
EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.
Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.
We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.

For online trading I am also going to have to sign off on whether we can trade with the UK based counterparty list, and I am probably going to need your help and your list to be able to do that.
I am totally unfamiliar with the UK based counterparties and in most cases their names aren't even in English so I can't even guess whether it would be an appropriate counterparty or not.
I am, obviously, most concerned about not approving trading with utilities and governmentals.
I've been searching that utility website trying to figure out which are utilities from that, and guessing at the names if it sounds like a utility or governmental.
Is your list done, or when will it be done?
Do you spell out if the counterparty is governmental/utility?
What help can you give me?

FYI, Ken we may want you to speak to Peevey and Freeman.
I believe that discussion should frame the proposal and attempt to set up a meeting with his staff and advisors to answer questions about credit and documentation.
In the propsal, we have tried to frame the potential credit and legal holes in their RFP with our suggested language or documents.
It would be helpful for the commercial team in ENA/EES to meet with these gentlemen and their advisors to describe the proposal and perhaps move towards negotiating a transaction.
The proposal includes: a) traded power products of various sizes and terms; b) unit contigent tolls from Pastoria (750MW) and Las Vegas Cogen (222MW) for term; c) natural gas packages for size for one through five year terms to provide gas hedges for their QF portfolio or other contracted merchant toll contracts; and d) an preliminary proposal on DSM from EES.
I will forward an executive summary from Chris Calger with more detail.

Although this new tagging won't be implemented until March, we will have access to the Test site sometime in November or December.
This new way of tagging is very different from what we have now, and each group that makes tags is going to have to allow time for practice.

New templates will need to be created.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product.

If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.

If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.

For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Here are issues which I'm unclear about, all of which impact the drafting of the agreement: How are we setting the heat rate?
Do we have the GADS (?)?
Is it a daily average, weekly average?
Flat rate?
Adjusted?
If so, how often?
Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions?
We have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil, right?
We aren't making money on gas, right?
Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet, and if so, how does it fit in to the picture?
Is there an up-to-date set of exhibits?
It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the following, in words and/or formulae: The defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) formula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to work on.
Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost of power)?
How are we setting the bogey?
Formula?
Subject to audit?
Two bogeys or one (gas and oil)?
What is defn of profit?
I think I have the general idea, but a sentence or two would be helpful as a reality check.
What costs are included on the buy and sell side?
Re stack model: a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used.
Updated exhibit on facilities, contracted resources, operating limits.
What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split costs/profits?
Are we clear that Cities buy gas, MDEA buys/sells power?
It would be great if I could get one set of answers to these questions/issues, which has commercial buy in all around.

We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.
To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from 0900 to 1100 (CST).
It is planned to include all traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.
Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our "live" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will: Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions: Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups: Profile tests for "external" customers (role-played by Originators) Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems Traders and Originators: Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products.
Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation.
Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties.
Credit limits, etc.

In reviewing the contracts, so far I have the following questions: 1.
Have Oman LNG and ADgas taken the risk of non-performance by DPC and indirectly MSEB without any credit support?
The only security is the equity in DPC?
Are such contracts typically secured or done with a buyer with deep pockets?
How much value was put into DPC by the shareholders?
2.
Are there local public policy issues that could be addressed by local courts with respect to the LNG contracts?
Fraud?
Bribery?
Are there any local law issues with respect to performance or interpretation of the contracts?
Isn't take-or-pay meaningless without credit support?
3.
What are the arguments for DPC to terminate the contracts?
Only where the PPA is terminated?
Payments?
4. Who negotiated the contracts?
Were there requests for credit support?
From Enron?
Did Enron ever promise to indirectly "backstop" the contracts by its investment in Dabhol?
5.
What was the discussion regarding the "reduction in operational capability" language in the contracts?
What was the language meant to cover?
Do we need our counterparty's approval to investigate other markets?
6.
Is there any argument that DPC has already breached the contracts?
Could our counterparties issue a press release claiming damages over the entire term of the contract?
Confidentiality and press releases?

TO: All Current Enron Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan Due to an Enron programming error in the transmission of data to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan administrator, a number of currently active employees were erroneously coded with a status of terminated on the Savings Plan system.
As a result, you may have received a notice from Hewitt Associates, the Savings Plan administrator, indicating that you were a terminated employee and providing you with options for your Savings Plan account.
This notice was sent in error, and should be disregarded.
This situation was identified and corrected.
We regret any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused.

Hey, Everyone's asked me how the happy hour was last night.
What a joke.
Apparently everyone left about 9:00.
And here's the best part...Brad (new guy) was walking up as everyone was leaving.
Wasn't it nice of him to call and tell us that everyone was gone?
Or at least telling the bozos leaving that I was planning on coming so that someone would have called?
I told Jeff he owes me a Happy Hour b/c that definitely didn't count.
He said we'd have to do a Happy Hour that was for Susan and me.
I told him I wanted my Happy hour on the beach in Cancun.
I searched the internet for flights and sent him an email with the flight information.

Michelle, here is a suggested revision to Section 3.4 B which I believe will accomplish the objective we discussed.
We need to draft procedures to be adopted by the Committee.
B.
If a terminated employee who is entitled to receive a severance benefit under the Plan receives a notification of layoff from Enron in compliance with the Federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, is placed on a period of paid leave of absence or furlough before termination of employment by Enron, and continues on the payroll of Enron for such period, the severance benefit payable under the Plan shall be reduced and offset, in a manner prescribed in procedures established by the Committee, by the amount of pay received by such employee during such period.

I thought that you might want to know that Randy Gay's wife passed away on Friday evening.
Randy is the Manager of the West Desk Gas Logistics group.
His wife had been on a liver transplant list for some time and had been moved up on the list several weeks ago as her condition became more severe.
Unfortunately, she developed complications during the last two weeks which resulted in her being removed from the transplant list.
Randy has a four year-old daughter.
Several of us will be attending the funeral today.
Over the past several weeks within ENA, we have raised funds for playground equipment to complete a fund raising effort that Randy's wife had headed for their civic association.
Through donations from ENA employees, the original goal for the playground equipment was far exceeded.

Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.
The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29: ?
Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.
The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.
?
After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.
As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.
?
The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.
Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.
This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.
These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.
To move funds: On the Web, choose "Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation" from the drop down menu.

Dr. Lay - The decision to go with Planners Services Group versus Extraordinary Events, TBA Inc., or Ward & Ames was made by the ONE ENRON Holiday Party Planning Committee.
(Planners has an established relationship with Enron Field and coordinated ECT's Holiday party there last year.)
Each vendor gave creative presentations and were very similar in capabilities.
While Ward & Ames provided sound ideas in their proposal, there were a few aspects that affected the final decision.
Ward and Ames' proposal was over budget when calibrated against other bids, holds an internal perception of being "controlling" vs flexible (i.e.
logo launch & Portland adopted elephant event) and presentation was satisfactory but not outstanding when compared to others.
Overall each of the vendors would have been capable of handling the event, but in the end Planners was unanimously selected by the Planning Committee.

ISDA PRESS REPORT - OCTOBER 19, 2001 CREDIT DERIVATIVES * Regulators Seek More Data About Credit Derivatives - Wall Street Journal LATIN AMERICA * WORLD NEWS: Brazil's weakness set 'for some time' - Financial Times OPERATIONS * Bank of New York demands back-up links from customers - Financial Times RISK MANAGEMENT * DTCC seeks to address post Sept 11op-risk concerns - Risk News Regulators Seek More Data About Credit Derivatives Dow Jones Newswire WASHINGTON-U.S. bank regulators, saying the notional amount of credit derivatives at banks has increased more than sixfold since 1997, from $55 billion to $352 billion, are proposing new reporting requirements on credit derivatives.
The requirements focus on what are known as bank call reports, which banks file with the federal bank regulatory agencies each quarter; these are used to monitor the condition and risk profile of reporting banks and the industry as a whole.
In a joint notice, the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said tile new Items proposed to be added to call reports should result in a "minimal additional reporting burden" for affected banks.
WORLD NEWS: Brazil's weakness set 'for some time' Financial Times; Oct 19, 2001 By Raymond Colitt in Sao Paulo Brazil's financial markets have recovered this week, halting at least temporarily the downward spiral of the Real.
But few analysts support the government's hopes of asustained currency recovery that would allow interest rates to come down and economic growth to resume.
With a tighter monetary policy and somewhat brighter short-term prospects after elections in neighbouring Argentina, the Brazilian portion of the JP Morgan's EMBI+, emerging markets bond index, has narrowed by 133 basis points since October 8.
By mid-week, the Real had recovered to RDollars 2.70, up 4.5 per cent against the dollar from its post-attack low.
Future interest rates also came down by more than 60 basis points this week.
The Real had depreciated 30 per cent against the dollar since the beginning of the year, raising concerns about the country's inflation target and credit outlook.
However, the currency weakness "is here to stay", says Marcelo Carvalho, chief economist with JP Morgan Chase, the investment bank, in Sao Paulo.
"The fundamental problems of the Brazilian economy have not changed and the market outlook remains uncertain."
Indeed, a consensus forecast published by the central bank sees the currency at RDollars 2.80 against the dollar at

As you may recall, the SAP system response time was slow during the September Quarter-end close period.
The Integrated Solutions Center (ISC) has been working diligently to address the root causes of this issue and can report that significant progress has been made.
With the October month-end close fast approaching, we want to provide you with an update as to the progress made in identifying and addressing the root causes for slow system response.
Poor Performing Programs The ISC has identified a number of poor performing programs.
Some program redesign has already occurred with continued efforts proceeding through year end.
In addition, system and data base parameters as well as indexes have been tuned.
These actions have resulted in improvements that should enable Enron to realize better system response in the upcoming close.
Workload Distribution The ISC has identified jobs, both scheduled and user submitted, that result in system "bottlenecks".
We have accelerated the purchase of system hardware to provide additional capacity and expect this upgrade to occur prior to year-end close.
In addition, the ISC has implemented a plan to provide business users with more information regarding efficient methods of report execution.
Workshops are currently being conducted with key "close-users" from the various business units to provide techniques that will enable more efficient report execution during the close process.
Improved Close Monitoring The ISC has been working to heighten the monitoring of key close jobs in order to more effectively identify and resolve close related issues.
An initiative is underway to improve the utilization of automated tools to better monitor, identify, and escalate close-related problems.
Communication Strategy Implement The ISC has established a plan to more effectively communicate to our customers in the event of future system performance issues.
This plan will ensure that information will be provided to users regarding system performance and resolution status in a timely manner.
Please feel free to contact me if you would like additional details regarding our efforts to improve overall system performance.

How goes you choosing a date for NYMEX ACCESS training?
I faxed you the schedule.

Dear Jeff, You may recognize my name as a member of the Houston YPO chapter.
We met briefly at the April technology program, which by the way, was fascinating.
I read in the Houston Business Journal of the San Francisco pie incident and thought your follow-through on the speech was perfect.
Look at the bright side, you're in great company!
I'm writing to solicit your advice on how my business can best capitalize on the ever-changing energy business.
As some background information, I'm responsible for a group of companies that are primarily in the businesses of manufacturing, personalizing and mailing laser printed billing statements and credit cards.
Personix is an industry leader in the markets we serve and Enron is a larger user of the types of services our company provides.
At the present time, we do not do business with Enron.
I've read where Enron has established an electricity retailing operation in anticipation of the Texas electricity market deregulation.
We would like to discuss with the appropriate person in your organization how our billing statement solutions may be of interest to Enron for your various energy and broadband businesses.
I would appreciate it if you could pass our name along in order to advance these discussions.
Thanks and look forward to seeing you at the next YPO event.
Regards,

The Enron Center Garage has opened.
Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and are currently parking in an Enron Contract garage or on the parking waitlist you are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.
This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage.
Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis.
The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.
If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available.
The Sky Ring that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001.
All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Sky Ring access is available.
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble.
If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision.

As soon as I saw the problem (early Sunday morning), I left a Voice message on Jeff's phone, Prentice's phone and also a live message with the paging service for Jeff.
When it was time to determine what to do (i.e., the games were about to start), I looked at the scores on Tennessee and Seattle and both were fairly high in the picks - Tenn ave. of 10. so I figured that you must have meant to put 11 on one of your #12 teams.
I put the #12 on the team that alphabetically came first, put 11 on Tennessee, and lowered all remaining numbers to come back to 1.
(You did not have a 1 pick in what you sent.)
I honestly did what I thought you were trying to do, so I'm sorry if it wasn't the right thing.
Donna had come over to watch the game, so I couldn't really talk when you called the last time and even though you were trying to give me what you meant, the Seattle game was already over, so I don't think it would have been fair to change it at that point.
Did you have a marvelous time???
Did they like the tomatoes?

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.
You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM.
All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.
When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.
The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.
New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period.
Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels.
This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.
If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.
We obviously have a lot to talk about.
Last week we reported third quarter earnings.
We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.
Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.
I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.
As usual, I will be as candid as I can.
I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.
I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

Hi there.
I am attaching for the group's consideration a red line that I ran comparing the current working draft (v4) with the draft John R. recently circulated to Tax and Insurance.
I suggest that Pete Thompson keep the typewriter on this.
We are getting so close to the end, I would really like to try to avoid confusion.
I am also attaching a clean copy of the current active version, and the current list of issues under consideration.
I suggest we work through this list and turn another draft before soliciting Cris/Herman and Lisa's comments.
We should also give the ENA commercial reps the opportunity to review it at that time.

Thank you for taking time to come to our Gas Logistics Staff meeting on Tuesday.
My apologies to those individuals that were inadvertently dropped from the email distribution.
I will schedule time to visit with anyone that missed the staff meeting.
I know that you are all still searching for answers to the Enron events of the last few weeks.
You asked lots of good questions at the meeting.
At the bottom of this email are responses to a few additional questions.
As I said at the meeting, while I am discouraged by recent events, I am really proud of ETS and of our Gas Logistics Team and I am looking forward to showing off our pipeline successes to the Dynegy management team in the future.
With the Thanksgiving holiday just around the corner, I'd like to take the opportunity to wish you and your family a safe and happy holiday season.
I hope that you can spend time with your families and friends away from the demands of work.

Michelle, Kristin Walsh, a manager in Competitive Analysis, is returning from maternity leave on October 15th.
During Kristin's absence, the following changes have occurred in the group, and I just wanted to run them by you before we communicate them to her: 1) Kristin will only have two direct reports instead of three.
2) Previously, Kristin's team as a whole was responsible for providing ENA (i.e.
John and Louise, as well as traders) with competitive intelligence.
Instead of Kristen just overseeing the ENA process as a whole, Kristin and her two team members will have more specific duties, although Kristin will still be the primary point of contact for ENA.
Specifically, Kristin will gather and provide intelligence info for the Gas Team, and Kelly Holman will gather and provide info for East Power, and Greg Whitman will do the same for West Power.
Robert Johnston, Kristin's supervisor, and Scott Tholan, BUL, just felt like the level of service that Kristin's team was providing was not adequate because efforts were duplicated and Kristin could not provide enough "face time" with the head traders to gather and relay info, as well as directing her team.
Also,after Kristin's departure, it was learned that Kristen signed a contract for which she had no authority.
Although Scott does not think that this has happened before, this particular contract blew up in their face.
Upon Kristin's return, Scottt, Robert, and I would like to communicate these changes to her (not in writing, just verbally), and just reitterate the fact that only Scott has the authority to sign contracts.
Additionally, we would like to tell Kristin that she needs to take a management training class so that she can learn to delegate and oversee responsibilities of the group, rather than micromanaging them.
Please let me know if this is going to create any additional problems, or if I need to take a different approach.
As always, thanks for your help.

Some of the accountants have been able to flag a few items that can be archived but it has only been a very little.
Most of them are asking the same question.
They want to know if there will be file cabinet space to store the items that they are not ready to send to archive but have no room to store on their desks?
This is placing a hold on the archiving project because I can't archive anything that the accountants won't give me the go ahead on and quite frankly, this is nearly everything I touch.
Please help.
Maybe if they knew where their things were going to be stored, I could at least help box it up for them to move with them.

A water pipe broke under the street between her house and the old Hamilton house.
She said water was shooting everywhere and that they were to turn off the water for at least 5 hours.
Well, they worked fast because when I got home at 6:00, I had water.
So I made some turkey soup.
But Willow Lane will be torn up for a while as it just buckled the cement.
The hole was about 7 feet down according to Tracy.
Good thing this didn't happen on Thanksgiving!

As things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently.
Organizational Matters The Creditors' Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee.
This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees.
The Creditors' Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11.
Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections.
Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain.
From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun.
Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.
We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.
Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.
This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.
By now, you must have heard of "NETCO."
This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enron's most valuable business, the wholesale energy business.
Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership.
We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO.
It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO.
The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder.
We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January.
As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention.
This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors' Committee.
We will update you periodically on our process.
Personnel Matters As a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization.
Office of the Chairman - Enron Corp Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along

My trading operations team, under the leadership of Mary Solmonson, is sponsoring a working session on Thursday and Friday, June 15 and 16 in the ballroom at the Rice.
Mary leads the team that manages Global Databases, our global contract, counterparty and facilities databases that create the common platform that facilitates the consolidation of information for credit aggregation, risk exposure, customer information, feeds to SAP for financial reporting, etc.
In addition to managing these databases, Mary has harnessed information from these databases in a new way to create an effective prospecting tool for use by originators and traders.
This tool can help measure and increase coverage by industry segments.
This project, Entelligence, has been endorsed by Greg Whalley and Jeff Shankman and is currently under development for delivery later this quarter.
We invite you to speak to the group of Enron employees from offices worldwide who will attend the working session next week.

Guys, I have spoken to Cliff and Mark and we are comfortable moving forward under the structure we have discussed.
FCEL: - $5MM in equity and 1.3MM warrants from corporate treasury stock that vest based upon 60MW of orders; - discussion with FCEL in which we disclose ALL infromation we have about the potential Conn. deal - I will require that myself and Mark be on that call; - the transaction is fully press released immediately.
CRRA: - subject to final due diligence on the development risks, we provide the management and wrap for CRRA on the potential fuel cell development opportunity that consists of between 25 and 50 MW; - any appropriation of funds from the government will require DPUC hearing at which we will fully disclose in a factual manner our interest in FCEL.
I will require that Mark Haedicke manage this process and sign off on all press releases, term sheets, disclosure discussions, contracts and regulatory filings.
I believe that we have this managed appropriately as long as we manage the process as per the script and in a factual manner.

Dawn, In the files you have sent for the 2002 Corp. Costs you have a column for ETS HQ.
It appears that there are several companies' allocations in that one column.
We will need to see the Co. 366 costs broken out from these other companies.
For example, if you have included costs for Co. 1202 and Co. 1195, these need to be separated out in detail.
Both Co. 1202 and Co. 1195 have employees.
Co. 366 allocates their costs and we will not know the dollars that belong to these other companies without a breakout in your spreadsheet.

Hello Long time no see or hear!!
Thank you for sending me a note - I've only just got into this e mail lark as we didn't have it on the computors at work until this year - and then I'm not supposed to be using it oh well.
How is America?
I had no idea that you where there or that you had had a baby, Denise came to Majorca this summer and she filled me in on peoples whereabouts.
How old is you little boy and what's his name.
It's winter season here and very little work to do - that's why I am e mail mad to try and fill in my time.
Only got 2 days left and then I am finished until Feb, depending on how things go with bookings etc after New York.
I usually go home for Christmas every year but my nana died at the beginning of the year and now we don't have a base to stay (me, sally and mum) so i am going home on the 8th of Dec until the 18th and having Christmas here instead.
My mum has been here for 2 years now, well 2 summers and a bit of winter.
she originally came to help me with Louisa just after she was born as I went back to work when she was 3 months and mum looked after her for me during the day, but now as she hasn't got nana to look after she decided to come back and helps me out a lot as my hours are not always a straight 9-5.
Louisa goes to nursery during the week and mum and I juggle the hours between us ( I say mum and I as Toni is about as useful as a chocolate fireguard ) My sister is an art director for Vidal Sasson, doing very well for herself, she runs the new salon in the city in London and is always jetting of to Japan and other exciting  ⁇ places, still single no children but loves Louisa to bits.
Anyway enough about me, how is life in America, do you work or are you a lady of leisure?
Louisa is nearly 3, but I imagine your little boy isn't at school yet is he?
does he look like you or your husband?
Louisa is blond with blue eyes, nothing like either myself or Toni - she is very much like my sister and my dad.
I have been at the hospital today to see a specialist with her as she was born with a

Mr.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS West Power On August 31, 2001, West Power Origination closed the sale of 100% of the membership interests in Southwest Power to Black Hills Energy Corp.
The sale to Black Hills concluded a two year strategy associated with the acquisition and expansion of the 50MW Las Vegas Cogeneration facility.
The 230MW Las Vegas II expansion project initiated in January 2000 consists of two, 2x1 systems utilizing LM 6000 PC technology in combined cycle.
In May of this year, West Power Origination secured a 15-year tolling agreement with Allegheny Energy Supply Company for the entire output of the expansion project.
The Las Vegas II expansion project is currently under construction and is scheduled to go commercial in September 2002.
This transaction utilized many of Enron's technical, financial and commodity capabilities.
Congratulations to everyone who made it a success.

Hi Gregg, I'm back.
I don't know what the deal was with my cell phone this week.
Perhaps the problem was the weak signal in the area.
Several people commented that they had problems reaching me, and my phone was on almost the entire time.
In fact, I made many calls, but I ususally checked to see if I had a signal first.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
I'll take a look at the DASH, etc, and get up to speed so that I can speak intelligently.

State Regulations Forces Questar to Cancel Part of Southern Trails Salt Lake City-based Questar Corp. went out to bid earlier this month on four new compressors to complete its conversion work on the east-of-California portion of its 705-mile Southern Trails Pipeline from the San Juan Basin to the Long Beach port area of Southern California.
The portion of the converted oil pipeline between the California border and the Four Corners Area in New Mexico will open June 1 next year, a Questar spokesman said Monday.
It is unlikely the almost 300-mile portion of the former oil pipeline in California will be brought into natural gas service due to state regulatory provisions that make it uneconomic for prospect customers to leave their local supplier for part of their gas supplies.
Questar currently is looking for optional uses and a potential buyer for that portion of the project.
Whether any of the pipeline's proposed 110 MMcf/d of supplies gets into California would depend on the takeaway capacity at the border and/or what a new operator on the California side might do with the pipeline, Questar's spokesperson said.

This morning I raised a concern regarding TW's sale of excess fuel at downstream points.
Here's the problem: the tariff requires shippers to tender fuel to us at their receipt points.
With rare exceptions, those receipt points are not at the Cal.
border.
Order 636 mandates that pipelines unbundle transportation from storage.
It also requires that pipelines that make gas sales do so at the furthest upstream point on their pipeline.
That latter requirement means that if a pipe buys gas at point "x", it should resell the gas at point "x" and not haul the gas to point "y" and then sell it there as a delivered (i.e., bundled) product.
My concern this morning was that our receipt of fuel gas in the San Juan or Permian and shipment of that gas to the Cal.
border for sale arguably violates the unbundling requirement (because the Cal.
border sale is a bundled combination of the sale and the transportation of the gas to the downstream location) or the "furthest upstream point" requirement or both.
Susan and my recollection was that when ECS wanted to receive the Gallup fuel deliveries at a point other than Permian pool, we made them sign a transport contract to move the gas to where they wanted it.
I haven't confirmed that recollection but I am recalling that we told Courtney that we couldn't just move our fuel gas around whereever we wanted it--we needed someone to pay us to transport it.

All: I spoke with Bill Bradford to get the global credit perspective, and, he is entirely neutral.
However, he agreed that it made sense for Enron Corp. to transact on its own stock.
I am prepared to draft new ISDA Master Agreements with our remaining potential targets in the name of "Enron Corp." without Credit Support Annexes.
Upon execution, the parties generally exchange evidence of authority (i.e., resolution or excerpt thereof).
The outstanding confirms are in the name of Enron Corp.
These are "Deemed ISDA's" and no party has asked for evidence of authority (although the parties do represent that they have such authority).
Please let me hear from you if someone objects to the use of Enron Corp.
Thanks.

Enron and Dynegy each announced today that they are holding discussions about a possible merger of the two companies.

This is just one of several options that we are considering.
Upon receipt of this announcement, the NYSE briefly suspended trading of both Enron and Dynegy.

Just wanted to drop you a note before I leave for Germany tomorrow.
I'm looking forward to the cooler weather.
I got some good bargains on post winter sweaters this weekend because no one in Houston is even thinking about buying a sweater!
I spent more money on clothes than I ever have at one sitting!
My backyard is really looking good.
It's almost all planted, maybe 90% done.
I've planted a few new trees, a Japanese Red Maple, and a Saucer Magnolia (which has lovely little pink fragrant blossoms).
It will be a while before they look like trees, though.
Right now they kinda look like tall bushes.
I've planted a lot of tropical plants, I've got a ten ft. plumeria (which is what they make the Hawaiian leis out of) which has little little yellow fragrant blossoms, and an Australian fern tree, which is about 7 ft. tall and looks kinda like a palm.
They're in pots, because I'll have to take them in during hard freezed.
I've planted lots of climbing pink, yellow and white roses and one mauve hybrid.
It will take a while before they fill out.
Also, two pink/purple crape myrtles, which should add a lot of color.
Those are those colorful small trees that bloom all over Houston.
I've planted a lot of stuff with scent, and stuff to attract birds and butterflies.
I hope the next time you come it will have filled out a bit.
Right now we've been having so much rain that they're drowning a bit.
I need a little sun to make them bloom.
And then there's my St. Francis fountain.
He's just lovely!

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.
Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.
The main areas to focus on over the next week are:- (i) Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7) To be forwarded to Louise These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.
The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.
(ii) Budget (due Jan 3, 2002) To be forwarded to Faith Killen First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized) (iii) Seating Plans Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv) Due Diligence We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday).
Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.
I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.
Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.
Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.
I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.
I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.
If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Roger, presented below are the comments which Transwetern has on the permits which were issued to the Klagetoh and Luepp compressor station.
The most critical and sensitive issue for us is item 2 below.
The permits really restrict us and cause us some major operational concerns if we are held to 25 ppmvd for NOx and CO throughout the entire operating range of the turbines.
We would really appreciate your help and assistance in this issue.
Let me know what additional information you may need.
1.The responsible official name change to Danny Pribble, VP Southwest Operations.
2.The draft permit limits NOx and CO emissions to 25 ppmv at 15% O2, based on a 3-hour average, except during periods of startup and shutdown.
At 60F and above the GE data indicates that these rates are achievable under all operating conditions.
However, GE data indicates that NOx and CO may be as high as 40 ppmv during low-load conditions of 60% and lower.
The permit application represented turbine operations at base load 80% of the time with reduced load operations (64% load)occurring no more than 20% of the time.
TWP also included a 15% safety factor to cover periods of reduced operating loads and fluctuating ambient temperatures.
The potential to emit calculations presented the emissions in the application in units of lb/hr and ton/yr.
These potential to emit values were accepted by the EPA for the netting analysis, and were taken into account by the EPA (See EPA Statement of Basis document).
Because the permit conditions hold us to ppmvd values and not lb/yr or ton/year values, Transwestern is concerned that under low load conditions of less than 60% and low ambient temperatures, the emissions of NOx and CO could go as high as 40 ppmvd.
Transwestern is requesting that a provision be made in the permit conditions that allows emissions of NOx and CO be held to 40 ppmvd during the 20 % of the time that the turbines operating conditions is less than or equal to 60% load.
3.
The word "Catepillar" is mispelled throughout the permit.
4.
Permit conditions for sulfur testing in the fuel gas requires Transwestern to use methodologies (wet chemistry technology) that are not normally used to monitor and measure sulfur in the natural gas.
Transwestern has received approval from the EPA for other custom fuel monitoring schedules to use "GPA Standard 2377" (length of stain tube) or gas chromatography as the proposed methodology to

During a news conference held late on 29 October, Attorney General John Ashcroft stated that intelligence sources have found "credible" information that the U.S. could be the focus for some sort of terrorist attacks within the week.
Ashcroft said the information received was not specific as to target or date of attack, but was of sufficient credibility to warrant sharing with the public.
He further called on law enforcement agencies, citizens and U.S. interests abroad to be on "highest alert."
Although no specific targets were mentioned, various federal agencies, including DOE, EPA, FAA, FBI and DOT have been alerted.
Effective immediately, and until further notice, DOE and NNSA have mandated that all activities shall add measures to their current heightened state of readiness designed to deter terrorist attacks by visibly increased perimeter security and security checks.
Changes in routines, including institution of random measures, shall also be implemented.
DOE and NNSA strongly suggest that the energy industry also implement these actions and to be on alert for any suspicious activities.

Thanks very much.

On December 21, 2000, I reported a weighted average price of $16.00 for gas flow on December 22-26, 2000.
The weighted average trade price via Enron Online will reflect a price of $15.76.
This price was increased to $16.00 to encompass trades transacted via the telephone.
The reason for the interest in this time period is as follows: Nicor Gas Company was closed for their company holiday on Friday, December 22nd.
As a result, volumes delivered at Nicor were traded for the December 22-26 time period.
Gas Daily published a price of $15.70 for the December 22-26 time period.
Nicor Gas Company made a decision to buy gas on December 22nd (even though they were closed) for the December 23-26 time period, which resulted in a $13.88 posting for the December 23-26th period.
I received several phone calls from various marketing companies expressing concern that Gas Daily was going to revise the posting, based on the minimal activity that transacted on December 22nd.
While, my practice is to simply take the price as reported on Enron Online, from time-to-time, there will be significant volumes transacted over the telephone that will impact the Enron Online price.
My volume is a little over-stated, but simply from a cursory glance standpoint, as opposed to intentionally reporting erroneous information.

Hi Marc!
Yes, we're having a few friends over Sat.
night for "Holiday Cheer" which at our house means cocktails by the Christmas tree and maybe some of my wonderful-tasting but horrible-for-you egg nog.
We'd love to see you guys.
It's just an 8 to 10 kind of thing so even if you have other parties to go to, you could make this one the kick-off.
The extent of FABULOUS in our Y2K plans is in the price of the bottle of champagne we're going to share at home that night.
I asked T if we should plan anything and got the "quiet night at home" reply.
That, of course, will change to "Why didn't you plan anything?!"
around 12/29 or 30.
How's BMC?
What are you doing for them?
Do you know Clayton Williams?
I think he still works there.
Give us a call so we can catch up.

Hi Folks, Another wild week in the NFL.
We've got Footballguy Scott Luebke's Week 7 Upgrade - Downgrade - Waiver Wire Picks.
Before we get to that though, let me throw out something I posted today on our message boards regarding owners who beat themselves up second guessing themselves.
This season has been as tough to predict as any in recent memory and I thought this might be something some of you might need to hear.
From our Message Boards www.footballguystalk.com One of our message board members was (justifiably) frustrated with watching Trung Canidate blow up on his bench while Ahman Green and Ricky Williams fared less well as his starters.
My reply to him: Don't be down on yourself.
That's the nature of the game.
There is no way you bench Ricky Williams or Ahman Green for Canidate when Canidate was such a question mark last week.
You did what just about every one of us would have done I'm guessing.
It's part of the game.
Is it frustrating?
Sure it is.
But it's still part of the game.
In my local league last week, I took a chance again on Antonio Freeman after starting him for the first few weeks (but not week 5 - Aargh... ) Did it play out?
No, it didn't.
I had guys on my bench who outscored him.
But looking back on everything I knew with Minnesota and Billy Schroeder, it was the right call for me.
I learned a long time ago the secret to Fantasy Football.
You just have to take the best info you can assemble, make your call and let the players do the rest.
Just like a real GM.
You can only do so much.
If you got beat because you didn't know Terry Glenn was out and you started him, well, that's your bad.
But if you got beat because Trung Canidate decided to play the game of his life, and proven RBs Williams and Green did not, well, that's not your fault.
I promise you, if you can predict things to that degree, you need to quit your job and head to Vegas.
Control what you can control.
Bust your butt to know all you can know.
Make the best decisions you can make and be comfortable you've done all you can do

Joe, see end of message.
Pig, the cart is in fine shape and has been taken to Austin by Chris and is being stored at their yard.
He advises that it should be retreived promptly, theft concerns.
Chad and I have been investigating Trailer costs.
400 to 500, unless we get lucky on a used one and they are scarce and we would still pay 350 for it.
Nobby Tires and lift kit can be done at Mission Equiptment for 800. to do it ourselves (read chad) will cost at least 500 i guess in parts.
My thoughs.
If you are still uncomfortable with transporting in your truck, then we need to spend the money to get the trailer and drive as is and built a box on the back.
If you think it is ok, then consider spending money to do tire and suspension job.
I will be in AUstin in a few weeks for depo and will be prepared to bring unit home in a) purchased trailer b)rented trailer c)pigs truck.
Need to make a decision here.
Joe: Any word on borrowing friends mothers trailer?
Any interest in becoming a part owner?
Any chance of being able to borrow Kim's grandfather's big ass trailer to be pulled by my truck???
Trailer issues per chris, pulling one axle trailer that distance is tricky.
May wobble if load not well balanced.
Probably ride better in back of truck or on longer two axle trailer which will track better.

In order to continually develop and make improvements to the functionality of EnronOnline we are rolling out several changes tonight, which will be in effect on Monday August 20, 2001.
Some of these changes will affect Stack Manager while others affect the Website.
A summary of these changes is listed below.
Stack Manager Changes Top of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader's stack price.
Stack Manger will list the price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the floated stack window.
Orders will be queued by price and time stamp.
When a counterparty trades on a " Top of Stack Entry" it will create back to back transactions; one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website.
In order to turn on this functionality select the " Allowed Top of Stack" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page.
If regular limit order functionality is desired the "Allowed" option should be selected.
Please note that this feature will be released in a disabled mode and will be turned on sometime next week after determining which business units want to roll this out.
Restricted Top of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted only by internal traders via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader's stack price.
Stack Manger will list price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the floated stack window.
Orders will be queued by price and time stamp.
When a counterparty trades on a " Top of Stack Entry" it will create back to back transactions one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website.
In order to turn on this functionality select the " allowed as Restricted Top of Stack" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page.
If regular limit order functionality is desired the "Allowed" option should be selected.
If a product has active orders against it you will not be able to select the "Restricted Top of Stack" feature.
Advanced Filtering Ability on All Products Tab - Drop down filtering capability is now available for each field in the All Products tab in stack manager.
In order to filter click on the arrow next to the field title.
A drop down box with a list of attributes will appear.
Highlight the attribute by which you wish to filter.

Jeff, I wouldn't be too concerned about calling you-know-who an asshole.
I don't think it hurt "W" too much, and it gave us all something to talk and/or chuckle about.
I am very fond of using it myself, but my favorites are "dickhead" and "dickbrain."
In fact, I used them so frequently that my husband urged me to use a Spanish translation, which turned out to be Ricardo Cabeza and Ricardo Sesos (pronounced "say-sos").
Please feel free to use those anytime you feel the urge.
Seriously, thanks for the good things that are happening at our company.
The stock is looking better, and us old folks appreciate that.
Hope you are taking time to enjoy life as well.
Are you doing the MS150 this year?

Judge McCartney presented her report on the SE RTO mediation to FERC last Wed.
Her recommendation was for the Grid model: Transco on top/Independent Market Admin.
(IMA) in the RTO (model presented by GridSouth, Grid Florida and Entergy) rather than Southern's model (Gridco on top, transmission owners and ind.
transcos under).
The Commissioners did not make a decision, but stated that they planned to address the SE RTO at the next Commission meeting on Nov 7 (after they have received comments on RTO week).
The judge discussed the biggest obstacles to public power agreeing to the Grid model: Southern gave them 100% transmission recovery on Day 1 and the Grids had a phase-in (pursuant to the Commission's previous orders in GridFlorida).
I think that many of the publics also liked the fact that Southern gave them full grandfathering of current contracts.
Chair Wood had questions about the split of responsibilities between the transmission-owning transco on top and the IMA and about the fiduciary duties of the transco board.
The judge stated that most publics wanted a non-profit ISO on top.
When Massey stated that most states wanted the traditional non-profit ISO, Wood said: "that would put the cabosh on this model," then asked why the publics don't like the operating agreements with the RTO.
There was discussion about concerns that the transco would favor transmission solutions over gen. Massey pointed out that the NE ISOs simply don't want their models changed, so that should not keep the Commission from approving the transco-type model.
Breathitt stated that cost/benefit analyses were important, especially for this region of low cost power.
Brownell stated that the Commission needed to act quickly because the market was already putting capital into transcos.

I had a rush approval on this list, so while you were out having a baby (well, actually Louise was doing all the hard work!
), I called Leslie at home at Elizabeth's direction because I had to get Sierra Pacific Holding Company approved.
We are currently purchasing power from them and Ed Sacks said we just gotten an EEI in place with them so Leslie approved them for both the bid and offer on west power (even tho Credit is going to open them up for purchases only).
No one has approved any other lists while you were out, so I have been patiently been waiting your return...sniff...sniff...

Just a followup note: We are still unclear as to whether we should continue to send original incoming and outgoing guarantees to Global Contracts (which is what we have been doing for about 4 years, since the Corp. Secretary kicked us out of using their vault on 48 for originals because we had too many documents).
I think it would be good practice if Legal and Credit sent the originals to the same place, so we will be able to find them when we want them.
So my question to y'all is, do you think we should send them to Global Contracts, to you, or directly the the 48th floor vault (if they let us!
).

Brothers, My youngest son Joe, a Beta pledge at Auburn, called me last night to inform me their chapter's charter has been revoked, effectively ending 34 years of Beta's at Auburn.
At a recent costume party, several pledges (Joe NOT being one of them) decided it would be funny to mock the all black fraternity on campus by painting their faces black and wearing that frat's letters.
As unbelivable as it seems, that one act set off a chain reaction in Oxford and the General Secy flew down and, in a two sentence statement, ended life for the Betas as they once knew it.
The incident coincided with the Delta Sig chapter doing something even more stupid at a separate party on a separate day where pictures showed up on the internet by their party photographer of three D Sigs dressed as a black, a KKK clansman and a Confederate soldier, all looking as if they were trying to hang or shoot the black.
Brilliant huh???
That incident really got the student body in an uproar and then the Beta deal came to light about the same time and bam, goodbye Betas.
I only tell the story here because there have been many news coverages of both events across the country, making the Betas look like they were way out of line when, in fact, it was pretty harmless and the black fraternity really was only tremendously upset with the D Sigs.
Joe, his pledge brothers, and the actives are in shock at the severity of the decision by Oxford and I must admit, so am I.
If any of you out there have any ideas on what to do about it, I certainly would welcome them.
Joe was really falling in love with that chapter and it had a ton of campus leaders in it, much like Gamma Omega did once upon a time.
My feeling is that the chapter deserved some serious and accountable disciplinary punishments and the chapter agreed what they did was stupid and in horrible taste, but to abolish a 34 year old, 120 man chapter for the actions of a few?????
I'm really pissed.
Yours in -kai-,

Has Paul contacted them about his note on 4/7?
If not, call Paul and find out if he wants you to make that call as that seems like the logical next step to take.
As far as their other comments, we cannot delete the Recording language on page 6 and in the Confirmation language let's offer up 5 Business days.

Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.
We want to encourage you to come to work.
We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.
Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.
I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.
But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.
I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.
Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing.
For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.
We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.
Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.
I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.
I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.
While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.
We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.
We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.
We will share more information on these efforts soon.
I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.
This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.
In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.
We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.
Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.
We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.
In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.
For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.
In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.
This quarter they are reported separately.
Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.
Following are the highlights of our businesses: Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.
Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.
Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.
While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.
Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.
So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.
Transportation and Distribution: Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT

Greg, I am a new Associate from Georgetown and I am very excited to be part of Enron.
I hope to earn great success in the future and will work tremendously hard to show my very best here.
I would enjoy an opportunity to sit down for lunch with you to hear your perspective on the company and success factors.
I think you would be an excellent person to talk to for two reasons: 1) Your success in the Associate Program and extensive multi-divisional experience within the company.
2) Your advanced knowledge of drivers and opportunities within the energy industry.

I'm in Houston this week and am available Thursday morning.
I would appreciate the opportunity to get together to discuss the intentions for disposition of the Sithe TCPL position.
I had figured that Geoff would value the pipe, take it in at a discounted position (paid for by Sithe with project equity), and then we would try to market it away at a higher value.
However, I have heard all kinds of different scenarios from within the company and would like to clarify this.
Please let me know if I can catch some time with you Thursday (June 7th) morning to review this.
Thanks.

Here is my proposal for a definition of Delivery Point to address the risk that RTO-West will change the existing delivery points to a zonal system: Delivery Point: Mid-C or, if the Delivery Point of Mid-C ceases to exist or is modified by RTO-West or similar entity, the zone, physical location, or bus that reasonably resembles Mid-C in terms of liquidity, homogeneity, and physical location.
Any suggestions?

The settlement with TBG has been completed.
We will be making a payment to TBG of $1.8 million on December 7.
New Agreement Same term - Sept 30, 2004 Terminate oud documents and replace with Master EnFolio Sell 12,500 MMbtu per day baseload - No swing quantites, and purchase is no longer tied to power production at TBG plant.
Enron has multiple delivery points and price protection for specific delivery location $1.8 million payment is less then possible amount due to TBG at end of year under current contract terms under "true up" provision.

Hi Jeff, Thanks for speaking last Wednesday on 29, it was my first floor meeting with you and I found it informative.
I like your informal, "no bones about it" style, a style I wish more people would adopt.
During the meeting you had made some references about your previous guest which concerned me.
As an employee and shareholder in Enron, it occurred to me that some of the comments would not benefit Enron if they were ever leaked out to the press, (ie.
like the Houston Chronicle article on the PRC process).
I do have one question to ask, with your light hearted comment about "Air India"; In order to achieve the vision of being the "World's Leading Company" do you anticipate we will further develop business activities within existing areas, or do you anticipate Enron becoming involved in entirely new business areas?
In other words, do you see us building new businesses which represent a natural evolution of our current activities, or do you anticipate something more radical?
A couple of months ago you said in an interview that you will continue running the company, in a business as usual fashion, will that change?
Thanks for taking the time to speak with us.

By now, a member of our SAP implementation team should have contacted you with information about your role as a timekeeper.
This role is very important at Enron.
By using a single time entry system, we will be able to gather the information we need to better manage our resources and their associated costs.
Time entered impacts payroll, finance and project costs real-time.
If time is not entered correctly, payroll, financial reports and project costing are negatively impacted.
We are quickly approaching the first SAP time entry deadline of June 30, at 3:00 p.m., CST.
It is critical that we work together to meet this deadline.
Within the next day or so, you will receive information from Yvonne Laing, our site manager, on what you need to do before June 30th.
Several mechanisms have been put in place to support you during time entry periods.
Beginning June 23rd, you can contact the Center of Expertise (COE) at (713) 345-4SAP with any questions or problems you are experiencing.
We appreciate your hard work and support to make our SAP implementation a success.
Sincerely,

Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.
Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.
We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.
Following are the major components of the transaction.

Tanya: There are a few issues left: (1) [re: legal name of our counterparty] According to FUNB, there is no legal entity named "First Union National Bank, Charlotte".
If S&P is including the city where FUNB is headquartered as part of their legal name, then S&P is wrong.
FUNB has asked that we forward the S&P document that you are looking at.
(2) [re: FUNB request to provide us with First Union Corp. financials and your response that it's OK if First Union Corp. signs on as a guarantor] FUNB says that First Union National Bank doesn't prepare annual statements.
FUNB can provide quarterly call reports (with YTD info) which is also available on the FDIC page (www.fdic.gov).
FUNB annual financials also available on EDGAR.
I don't know what a call report is and FUNB did not offer up First Union Corp. as a guarantor.
(3) [re: 10 year bonds which you agreed to accept as Eligible Credit Support] I don't know what the "usual haircut" is on these issues.
You said 90% or 95%.
Legal no longer offers up bonds in our documents which is why we haven't discussed haircuts lately.
(4) [re: the Specified Conditions of Tax Event, Tax Event Upon Merger and Credit Event Upon Merger] FUNB would rather terminate than collateralize Transactions (and eliminate obligations to transfer in avoidance of termination).
If a Specified Condition exists, then there is no obligation to deliver collateral to that party (experiencing the Specified Condition) and a Secured Party could exercise all remedies available to it against the Pledgor.
(I think that we have a different philosophy in that we would prefer to preserve Transactions).
I'm more willing to give in on the tax events (but global mergers could force that issue and the agreement basically requires the Affected Party to try to transfer the Transaction to avoid termination).
Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks.

Hello all, Attached is an updated sheet regarding what needs to be done at night regarding MDEA and our old nightly duties.
Also there is now a folder near the MAPP printer (between Dean and Don) that will include all the nightly faxes and load sheets.
The folder will help us keep track of what has been faxed in case EES trans calls complaining.
The load sheets are needed for the daily forecasting expained in the SOP 13 Dean sent out last week.
In the folder there are extra copies of the SOP 13 in case you want it as well as GENCO phone numbers in case Allegheny calls.
Hopefully this will help create some consistency on nights and provide the day people access to the MDEA load sheets.
If you have any questions please give me a ring.
Happy Holidays,

Dear Mr. Dasovich: I am looking for a position in the Bay area as my wife will begin teaching at the Goldman School of Public Policy in January.
Cecille Cabacungan from GSPP suggested that I contact you.
Currently, I am with Mercer Management Consulting, a strategy consulting firm.
While I enjoy my work with Mercer, the timing of transfers to our San Francisco office is uncertain.
Mercer, however, has two programs through which I could move to the Bay area.
The first is an externship program through which I could consult to a company for 6 - 12 months, or longer.
As my attached resume reflects, I have several years of experience developing business plans and assessing market conditions.
The second is a fellowship program through which I could consult to a non-profit organization for up to 12 months at a small fraction of Mercer's standard fees.
I am particularly interested in organizations that work on economic development issues, but would be happy to help a range of organizations develop and implement their long-term strategic goals.
Specific types of work I could perform include: * Assessing market size and growth opportunities, e.g., utility/profitability of new services or products * Managing co-operative efforts with other institutions, e.g., pooling resources to increase leverage and efficiency of operations * Benchmarking and redistributing resources to focus on highest impact areas I would like to learn whether you think Enron could benefit from my services or know of a corporation or non-profit that could.
I am arranging interviews for the first week of December, and would greatly appreciate talking to you before then to hear of any suggestions you may have.
I look forward to hearing from you, and thank you in advance for your assistance.
Sincerely,

Get your checks ($11.50 per ticket and payable to Oregonians for Nebraska) to Lisa Martin at 401 S. Everest Road #2 Newberg OR 97132.
If you have questions, you can contact her at lamartin59@aol.com.
We must have your check prior to February 10th.
In other upcoming events, the Oregonians for Nebraska 3rd Annual Founders Day celebration is scheduled for Saturday, March 9th.
The festivities will kickoff with an exclusive social hour for Blackshirt Club members only from 6 to 6:30 pm.
A social hour with a no host bar including a silent auction for all others will start at 6:30 with dinner served at 7:30 pm.
Throughout the evening, there will be door prizes and an exclusive raffle for those attending who are Alumni Association members.
The event is taking place at McMenamins Edgefield Manor in Troutdale.
Edgefield is a unique European-style village, which includes lodging, a pub with a movie theater, fine dining, a winery, a brewery, distillery, golf course, gardens, vineyards, artwork, meeting, wedding and banquet space, and special events year round.
Edgefield, built in 1911, served for several decades as the Multnomah County Poor Farm.
Residents operated a self-sufficient environment, raising hogs, poultry, growing a variety of fruits and vegetables, operating a dairy, cannery and meat packing plant as well as working in the laundry, kitchen and hospital.
In 1947, it was renamed the Multnomah County Home and Farm and in the late fifties the farm operation was eliminated.
In 1962, the facitity was renamed Edgefield Manor and for the last two decades of operation, functioned as a nursing home and eventually closed in 1982.
McMenamins purchased the property from Multnomah County in 1990.
In phases lasting over four years, the condemned buildings and land were transformed into a place that is quite special.
Edgefield also offers over 100 bed and breakfast rooms creating a unique lodging experience.
Spacious rooms are furnished with cozy and inviting decor from the turn of the century.
Televisions and telephones are absent from the rooms, encouraging a tranquil retreat atmosphere.
If you are interested in spending the night on the 9th, contact Edgefield directly at 503-669-8610.

To add to Bev's comments, I've gotten many calls from large customers today.
I'll be meeting with them in Sacramento on Monday to discuss the core/noncore structure further and try to craft a core/noncore structure that makes sense.
I've also asked Sandi and the Sacramento team to line up meetings with key legislators while I'm there to discuss the same.
Business is, as was expected, very unhappy about that portion of the plan that would stick them with all of Edison's debts.
They view it as unfair and punitive (which it is) and are frustrated that the Democrats would include it simply to "make the deal Harvey proof."
Many questioned Keeley about why the Democrats are hell bent on pandering to Harvey.

With the filing of the Hart-Scott-Rodino application last week, it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows.
Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift: Week of Jan 28: We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications.
The packets will contain: Key Messages Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Top Counterparty Checklist External Customer Cover Letter Password Application (PA) Registration Form Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA) Internal online Marketing Contact List Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA).
During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible.
Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site.
A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com.
This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users.
The Splash page will look something like the following: Week of Feb. 4: We will send out a mass mailing to approx.
3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site.
Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.
Week of Feb. 11: The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues).
General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
Trading/Origination Coordination The Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days.
An online marketer has been assigned as coordinator for each company and will assist each Trader/Originator in following up with Master Users as necessary to make sure PA's are signed and

ISDA Credit Support Annex - Paragraph 4 provides that our counterparties do not have to post or release collateral to us if either an Event of Default, Potential Event of Default or Specified Condition has occurred or if an Early Termination Date has been designated for which an unsatisfied payment obligation exists.
In addition, as you are aware, we can no longer hold cash or LC's, and as we discussed, since this language technically applies to LC's as well, it might be worth it to appoint a QI to hold our LC's for us.
2.
Industrial Master - same as above except that the limitation on holding collateral only applies to cash.
3.
Annex B - the Event of Default/Early Termination Date conditions only apply to requests to reduce collateral, not to a demand to post collateral.
There is no QI requirement for holding collateral.
4.
EEI Master (without new collateral annex attached)- no conditions precedent in the EEI to posting or releasing collateral.
There is no QI requirement for holding collateral.
The new collateral annex works like the ISDA Credit Support Annex except that the limitation on holding collateral only applies to cash 5.
Enfolio Master Purchase and Sale Agreement - no conditions precedent in the Enfolio to posting or releasing collateral.
There is no QI requirement for holding collateral.

Guys, Power Systems has given me a proposal to replace the New Albany and Doyle 7B burners.
This could possibly have two benefits: a) elimination of the possibly tainted equipment given current patent issues they are having with GE and b) apparently the newer technology significantly reduces the Nox emission correlating into increased operating hours.
I need two things to determine if we want to move forward: a) Mark we need to be bullet proof on the patent (or lack thereof) issues on the new equipment and that it would protect us from further exposure and b) Mitch, Kevin, Mike and Bob, I need your technical and commercial opinions on the merits of this proposal (ie) do you as a team support this proposal?
I believe the timing on this is rather short.
Please get back to me at your earliest convenience.
I will forward a copy of the proposal to each of you.
Regards

Big ticket item on here is the group dinner in Dallas for the ASE.
I can view the entry and can click on attendees - but only see a list of 10 or 12 attendees.
There were 30 or so, plus Greg Piper and Lisa Petruska.
I am missing a second page of attendees, or were only a few listed?
If I am not missing a page, please ask Heather to include the complete list of attendees (all who were at the ASE plus Greg and Lisa).
A $4,000 meal for 10 attendees looks funny.
There were many more in attendance.
The cost of the meal makes more sense with a complete list of attendees.
Thanks.

Hi Mark, I would like to creat a product for Enron Online for trades on Alliance Pipeline.
As you probably know, Alliance is a new pipeline scheduled to start commercial service effective November 13, 2000.
As with any new pipeline, this date may or may not be pushed back to a later date.
I would like to create a product that has a description that addresses the uncertainty of the start-up date of Alliance Pipeline and simply states that gas will commence flowing when the pipeline goes commecial.
Please let me know if you have language that addresses this situation.
I would like to get this product set up as soon as possible.

FYI.
From our folks in Sacramento: AB 1085 is AES' competitive default provider bill.
It's not an emergency bill, so it will be dealt with throughout the remainder of the spring and summer.
AB 57 is a legislator's suggestions on how long-term contracts should be "regulated."
Also no an emergency bill.
AB18X is an emergency bill and it would create a core/noncore split in electricity similar to the one that exists in California's gas market.

Greetings Sally: My name is Jeff Dasovich.
The Greens have been helping me develop 40 acres of land that I bought just north of Anchor Bay (a couple of miles up the hill from Highway One, about 1200 ft or so up) and they suggested that I contact you.
The property is right in the heart of the Banana Belt and my property faces south, is protected, and a such is very hot and sunny from late spring through later summer/early fall.
The property has an abundance of water on it.
Of course, the possibility of evening fog raises some tricky issues, and I haven't done soil tests.
In short, while I think there are some challenges, I'm convinced that there is at least the strong possibility that I could grow grapes--around 10 acres or so.

EPPI Claim for 2000-2001 Enron Processing Properties, Inc (EPPI) assignment of the GPM Agency Agreement committed EPPI to reimburse KN (now Oneok) for all-in transportation rates above 4.45%.
NNG's must bill minimum rates and those rates are sometimes above the 4.45% all-in rate, therefore Oneok has submitted invoices for transport excesses of $79,165 and $222,315 for the years 2000 and 2001.
The invoices are currently being checked by Gas Logistics and once a final determination has been made coding instructions will be needed for this EPPI commitment.
Prior Claim (1997-1999) On 2/18/2000, KN submitted a claim for $363,211 covering 1997-1999, I checked the calculations and the claim was revised to $192,000.
During negotiations KN sold the agreements to Oneok and to my knowledge the prior claim was never paid nor were any more demands for payments made.

Phil Richardson and Sarah Tomalty of Dynegy say that they would probably (i.e.
subject to management approval) withdraw their protest if we would amend our proposed tariff language to limit the quantity of capacity we can acquire from PNM to 20,000/day.
Their chief concern is to prevent TW from becoming simply a broker for another pipeline's capacity (which has never been our intention).
Lorraine is discussing this with Steve to see whether this is something we could live with.
The Commission has expressed the same concern in the past, so this might make them more comfortable with our proposal too.

Frank: I spoke with her attorney yesterday and believe that I addressed her concerns with the ETA, GTC and Password Application forms.
She is going to add language to the Password Application that makes it clear that any GTC is considered to be "signed" and "in writing" if they are required by the Website to click on it.
Her main concern given the fact that we now have a Master in place with them is that they are not asked to accept the terms of a GTC and I assured her that so long as she has a Master in place that covers the product that she wants to trade that they will not be asked to accept a GTC.
Anyway, putting this language in the PA seemed to make her feel better.
Once you receive the PA from her why don't you fax it to me and I will let you know if it is acceptable.
Also, as I discussed with Stephanie yesterday, they wanted to do a "test" run on the Website to check to make sure that they would not be asked to accept a GTC.
I told her that the only way to do this would be to click on a product description once they get their password.
I understand that you and Tana will coordinate with each other when the time comes to make sure that the ISDA Master that they executed gets coded into the Website at the proper time so that when they do click on a product description, no GTC appears.
Please call me if you have any questions.

Paul: Got your voice mail regarding Anthony Pescetti running for a FERC seat.
Here are some quick thoughts.
Sue likely has some additional experiences and information to share.
Be happy to discuss further.
Republican assemblymember from the Sacramento area.
Was a member of the Sacramento muni utility district prior to going to the legislature.
Republican (minority) head of the assembly electricity oversight committee (the one that Rod Wright chairs).
Don't recall that he's ever seen a a pro-utility bill that he didn't like.
In fact, he sponsored some legislation just this past session that would have locked the utilities in to major parts of the gas industry, and specifically wold have locked out competition.
It was strongly opposed by industry and defeated.
When push came to shove, I can't think of a time he didn't side with the utilities.
Even when the Assembly Republicans were doing of good job of bottling up Davis' ridiculous bailout bills in Rod Wright's committee, Pescetti seemed to go along more to tweek the Democrats than to foster competition.
And even then, he followed; he didn't lead--other, more junior, members on the committee led.

Sally, here is a revised version of the savings for ENA, EGM, EIM, Back Office, Frameworks, and Corporate Systems.
There have been a number of changes as follows :- Back Office The headcount numbers have changed because the original cuts took into account bugeted headcount counts rather than working from our currrent position.
Ramesh Rao spent some time today revising those figures to better represent what it will really take to address the three scenarios.
Also the changes reflect what it will take to support EA business only.
EES - at least, part of it - was supposed to be integrated into UNIFY early next year and therefore EES had a 20% allocation from the backoffice.
EGM/EIM Jeff made some slight alterations to make sure that current employee counts were accurate, and base cont/consultant headcount more on average budgeted for next year rather than actuals today.
They assumed in budgeting that contractors and consultants would be reduced next year as new dev in Thunderball, Freight and EIM started to be completed The Summary page now shows savings rather than totals and all values are scaled to show millions.... regards

As per Fred's suggestion it is much better to buy from TEP at Springerville rather than PV.

We have arranged for a private showing of the movie Rogue Trader (complete with comfy chairs and popcorn) which I thought could be fun for the group to see as a means of setting the stage for our discussions on Monday and Tuesday.
This can be optional, as I know that jet lag my get the best of some.
The morning on Monday will set the stage: why we have gathered, endorsement of our efforts (Causey).
Perhaps you, Brent and I could each give a short "state of the union of operations" according to us - covering ENA, EGM and EEL).
Then definition of the operating standards that we must uphold, discussion, plans on reporting and buy in on these.
Monday lunch will allow everyone to share with their tablemates a project in which they are involved that will have an impact on global consistency of operational controls, or a project which through sharing or expanding could have such an impact.
Each table can report back as we gather to start the afternoon.
Having defined and discussed fundamental operating standards, we will move Monday afternoon to review of the Doorstep concept: what, why, how and lessons learned.
Then we will discuss next steps around this on-going project.
Just before the afternoon break, we will roll out a new communications tool for the operations controllers: a website tailored for the group.
We will finish the afternoon by tying in operations performance and its impact on assessing and measuring market risk and credit risk, with Ted Murphy and Bill Bradford addressing the group.
Monday evening will include a tour of Enron Field and dinner at Ruggles Center Field Terrace.
Bill Bradford will join us for dinner, and we are waiting for an RSVP from Ted Murphy.
Tuesday morning will start with Jeff Skilling as our real keynote speaker.
He plans to spend an hour plus with the group.
He will make an informal presentation and then will entertain questions.
The rest of the morning will be spent in breakout teams, with assignments to come up with specific action steps to strengthen operating controls, improve the accuracy of information provided and move toward best practices in providing mid and back office services within Enron.
Before lunch,

Mr. Skilling, As with the many employees here at Enron, I wish you all the best ahead.
I'm sorry to hear you leave but I know you have your reasons.
I'm sure we all can respect that.
I just wanted to send you a note to say thanks again for the things you've done for me since last summer.
They're greatly appreciated.
Hopefully, I will have the chance to meet with you again.
Wishing you the best and hopefully I will see you again.... Kindest regards, Tim Ng Analyst x30998

FYI - It appears the issue of how to execute inter-desk swaps is still not resolved.
I've attached the instructional worksheet Bill sent out awhile ago - it is actually a very coherent rendering of the intricacies involved in entering these enigmatic deals.
(Read: Inter-desk swaps are not real easy to understand.
This worksheet is.)
One tip: If STCA is long or short going into the Real Time market, they will have entered a purchase from or sale to the California Imbalance as a sort of "place holder."
An offsetting purchase or sale will need to be made under the STCA book in order to complete the deal and keep STCA flat.
If you're feeling ambitious and want to see the direct effects of putting deals in under the wrong book, run a Forward Obligation report (in Enpower Reports under the Risk tab) for the day, desk, and region in question.
If you did everything correctly, the report should produce nothing but zeroes.

Hi, Ken: I'm a former ECT VP who is just down the street, back at Ryder Scott Company which was my home before my six-years with Enron.
A great six-ears, in fact, I learned much and enjoyed the Company and the company, but it does feel better to be back in the "oil patch".
I still have stock and will continue to be a stockholder as I know the company will continue to be innovative and dynamic.
My reason for this email is a recent op-ed piece in the Houston Chronicle by Robert Buzzanco decrying the current campaign against terrorism.
His editorial was at best silly, fraught with inaccuracies (as a geological engineer I rely on facts - minorities make up 34.4% of the combined arm forces - not the opposite as suggested in Buzzanco's piece) and intended only to protract his personal agenda which has nothing to do with peace.
This may be more about selling his anti-American books than current events.
I could really care less about this person, he certainly has the right to conduct his protest, many have fought and died for his right and more may die in the coming days.
I do object to this guy using the University of Houston to lend credibility to his cause.
That's like an Enron employee (purely an example) marching in protests wearing the logo and identifying him or herself with Enron.
He is a private citizen when he writes an editorial or marches in protest.
He used his position at UofH to get his piece in the paper.
I know you are an alumnus, and I ask you to read his editorial (10/8) and respond according to your hear.
Keep the ship on course, Ken.
Respectfully Thomas M. Talley

As most people are aware, there are a variety of proceedings and investigations pertaining to the western wholesale power markets.
More than 50 market participants are involved in litigation on both the state and federal level.
We have no reason to believe that Enron has been singled out in any of these investigations.
Each person in the Portland office needs to be aware of and comply with our data retention policies.
These policies are not new.
I have previously sent out e-mails delineating our policy.
This e-mail simply serves as a reminder.
If you have any questions or concerns please let me know.
The purpose of this message is to update employees on the status of the California Attorney General's order regarding the preservation of business information.
Please NOTE THE IMPORTANT POLICIES DESCRIBED BELOW.
Please continue to ahdere to the following business information retention policies: (1) PERSONAL EMAIL: can be kept, discarded, etc.
at will.
(2) BUSINESS EMAIL: do not delete any business email sent or received for 24 hours.
This 24 hour delay will allow the network to save a backup copy of the email.
After 24 hours, BUSINESS EMAIL may be kept, discarded, etc.
at will.
(3) WORD PROCESSING FILES OR FILE FRAGMENTS: do not delete any SAVED FILE or any FILE FRAGMENT.
This policy covers any FILE or FILE FRAGMENT that you have saved on your hard disk or the network.
(4) DATABASES: do not delete any information in DATABASES.
(5) EXCEL SPREADSHEETS: do not delete any information in EXCEL SPREADSHEETS.
(6) CALENDARS OR SCHEDULING PROGRAMS: do not delete any information.
(7) OTHER ELECTRONIC DATA: do not delete any OTHER ELECTRONIC DATA.
(8) HARD DRIVE CAPACITY: in the event that you run out of disk space on your personal computer, you may copy files to the network (where they will be backed up), then delete the files from your personal computer to create the work space you need.
DO NOT DELETE ANY FILE BEFORE YOU HAVE COPIED IT TO THE NETWORK.
In our negotiations we have discovered no reason to believe that Enron has been singled out for investigation by the Attorney General.
We will update you as we learn more.
Thanks for your help in this matter.

Greetings Paul: Eric Boyt advised that TWPL was not in a position to deliver the full volume of approx.
363,000 mmbtu for the remainder of the month for the account of Enron Compression Services.
This would have been good information to know BEFORE we sold the gas.
I left a couple of messages today but never heard from you.
Unfortunately, we have sold this volume, at your repeated request, and are not in a position to retrade the deal.
To the extent TWPL is unable to perform, please call Janie Tholt or Randy Gay to see if they can reduce the commited volume.
I am scheduled to be out tomorrow but may have to come in for the afternoon.
Please advise ASAP.

ADesell@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List: Due to the terrorist actions in NYC which collapsed offices in the World Trade Center complex and reduced customer Load in that Transmission District, the ISO is re-calculating the Unforced Capacity ("UCAP") requirement for the Consolidated Edison Transmission District (CETD) and the New York Control Area.
The new UCAP requirement for the CETD for the Capability Period 11/1/01 to 4/31/02 is 12788 MW and the total UCAP requirement for the New York Control Area is 32892 MW.

Attached are the registration form and agenda for Friday's February 1 industry meeting in New York City.
This meeting is a continuation of Monday's Jan 28 industry collaborative at DOE to develop a "single" consensus standards setting organization by March 15, as directed by FERC.
Provided below is the matrix developed by industry at Monday's meeting identifying the areas of similarities and differences between the various models and proposals.
We look for you to review the matrix internally and be prepared to advance the discussion and start making the hard decisions in New York.
We strongly encourage all companies to participate in New York and the subsequent industry meetings.
FERC staff will present in the morning and industry will begin discussions and negotiations thereafter.
FERC is holding its Northeast Energy Infrastructure Adequacy Conference on Thursday, January 31 at the same Helmsley Park Lane Hotel.
It was a concerted decision to hold this meeting in New York City to allow for companies to maximize their trip North and participate in both meetings, if desired.
Please fax or e-mail the registration forms to jmastin @eei.org or the fax number provided on the registration form.
We have registered close to 75 persons for this meeting and need an approximate count of attendees to ensure adequate meeting space for all participants.
If you do not forward the form by COB Thursday, please contact us by phone and bring a completed registration form to the meeting.

The year-end performance evaluation process is a great opportunity for employees and their supervisors to review accomplishments for the year and identify opportunities for personal growth.
Additionally, it is an opportunity for each of us to provide meaningful performance feedback to help others.
This memo is intended to summarize the major elements of this important process and clarify the timeline for year-end 2001.
(Note: ETS employees on self-directed work teams that participate in the Skill-based Pay program will complete team and peer performance reviews as they have in the past and are exempted from the discussion that follows.)
Feedback and Evaluation Employees will solicit 360?
feedback on their performance via the PEP system.
The supervisor will use this feedback, along with other performance data about the employee, to prepare a written evaluation of the employee's performance for the year.
The employee and supervisor will then meet and discuss this evaluation which provides an objective measure of the employee's performance against expectations.
The performance evaluation is an opportunity to discuss accomplishments, areas for improvement and goals for the next year.
No overall performance rating will be designated.
?
PEP System open for feedback November 19 - December 7 ?
Performance discussions with supervisor December 10 - January 14 ?
Written evaluations due to HR January 15 Training for all employees on how to use the PEP system will be available via online tutorials.
Compensation Increases in an employee's base pay for merit, promotion or equity can be recommended by an individual supervisor based on the employee's performance, current responsibilities and salary.
Division Head approval is required.
As always, incentive awards are paid at the discretion of the Enron Board Compensation Committee and the Enron Office of the Chairman based on company and business unit performance.
Once bonus pools are approved, individual bonuses will be determined by division and department heads based on employee performance.
Relative Talent Reviews Relative talent reviews will occur beginning January 16, 2002 and will include discussions of Managers and above.
The focus is not on relative ranking but on identifying employees who best demonstrate the performance, skills and behaviors that are valued at Enron.
Each Division will identify its top 10% and discuss the utilization of its top talent.
Employees who may be ready to assume greater responsibilities will be discussed.
Recommendations for promotions will be considered up through Senior Director.
EGS executive management will review Vice Presidents and Managing Directors and identify the top 10% in this officer group.

Mr. Lay: First, I want to say that I've been a dedicated employee of Enron for 9 yea= rs now and, looking back over that time, it's been the greatest period of m= y life, career-wise.
When I first went to work for Enron, I was almost sta= rry eyed.
I was working for the home town team and it was just the greates= t company I had ever been associated with.
I started out with Enron Power = Corp. and the energy and focus within that group was just incredible.
I've seen a lot of change over the past 9 years.
Some great, some good and= some not so good.
But all in all, I would do it all over again in a heart= beat, because I still trust in the core of this company and decisions our = management have made.
But most of all, we've still got great people.
Base= d on the current events of the past 3 to 6 months, it does indeed look like= we are going to have to "do it all over again".

Daniel, Laura Luce would like to send the latest Enovate DPR to the chairman of People's Corp.
But the copies we receive have some sort of protection which I'm sure you are aware of.
Will you please send her the latest so that she can forward it to this guy?
Let me know if that is a problem.

Clint: after the meeting, Jim advised me that the ENE board resolution will be drafted for the Oct. meeting.
In the interim, he is convinced that only Enron Corp. should be a swap party to these equity swaps, forwards, etc.
I am going to speak with Rod Nelson (credit) and make some changes to our approach.
This should also make life easier negotiating with Lehman and Bear (from a credit perspecttive) but we'll reach an obvious stalemate when they ask for an Enron Corp. resolution (forthcoming after the relevant board meeting.

All, I attended the Market Issues Forum at the California ISO yesterday and wanted to inform you of an important upcoming change in Grid Management (GMC) rates.
Starting January 1st, 2002, the CAISO anticipates raising GMC charges significantly.
They cited the following reasons for this: 1.
An under collection of GMC for year 2001, this must be past on to the following year according to the tariff.
2.
The lack of credit for the CAISO, increasing interest charges, as well as creating an inability to issue bonds for capital projects.
They must raise 100% of any capital expenditures in the current fiscal year, rather then spreading out the cost over a number of years with a bond issuance.
3.
A decrease in overall market volumes.
GMC is allocated on a flat fee, per megawatt basis, so decreasing volumes results in decreasing collections.
The CAISO points out their costs will remain flat from 2001 to 2002.
They anticipate volume levels next year similar to what current volumes are, thus reducing the amount of megawatts they can effectively spread out their GMC charges over.
I have the following observations: 1.
Despite the decrease in volumes, and the decrease in overall market activity, the CAISO has no plans to reduce its current workforce of 500+ employees.
2.
When posed the question: Is CERS charged GMC for out of market energy?
Their answer was circumspect at best.
3.
The CAISO currently does not assess GMC charges to ancillary service volumes, they indicated however that they are strongly considering changing this policy to increase the denominator that they can spread out GMC.
The CAISO would also like to point out that these increases are worse case scenarios, and may not be this high.
But as we are all aware, in the California energy market, the worst-case scenario ends up looking optimistic in comparison to what actually ends up happening.
Below is a detailing of the changes.

I have been thinking about the cash book idea for group and I think we need to discuss this in more detail.
I would like to continue to use the physical for large prompt positions going forward.
I am afraid that the baseload volumes may not continue on their current trend if we break out the books.
We need to discuss how the cash books would lay off risk.
i.e.
Intra regional spreads with GD swap legs or spreads with other cash points and then booking out at gd mid to the internal counterparty.
Janie managing SJ and laying off risk on Steve's Opal.
I know that the cash books would be a good idea for dailies , but I am not sure how to do this without giving up the cash risk for baseload as well.
What are your thoughts?
I would also like to discuss the staffing issues.
Matt Smith and Susan Scott to analyst, Jay to the ROX, etc.
It seems like Ken S. has shown more interest in the west fundies lately.
Should we keep his services?
The basis products need another book.
Who can we add to the mix?
I think that we should look into having Frank focus on prompt month only.
He has a great interest in cash and fundies and this should serve him well in managing tight two ways for all products on the prompt.
Keith can do term with another book.
Monique is going to take over the gd swaps for Kern, SJ, and Perm.
I will continue to manage the CA products.
This should allow us to provide tighter two ways across the west.
I will continue to manage all index products and prompt month phys fixed price.
Operations needs more labor as well as an analyst or two to monitor flows.
The analysts will monitor flows by price and hopefully find creative ways to nom the market.
EOL.
Keith has a great idea of opening up all products to the desk so that you may insert a bid or an offer inside of the manager's markets.
We should propose this to EOL.
This would allow for tighter markets on all products and prevent the desk from working markets through the brokers.
Ca cash products.
Let's call a meeting about how to offer more Socal physical products.
I would like to have PG&E topock and Socal Ehrenberg before the summer.

Joe Hartsoe, Rick Shapiro, or Jim Steffes can fill you in on the details of what FERC did today.
One question you need to think about is how their decision on price caps affects any contracts which we may have indexed to California's spot market.
The way it reports the market clearing price will change fundamentally if prices over 150 will be accepted but not used to clear the market for all bids.
So, if we are using this as a reference price in our contracts it may trigger the need to look for alternatives.

Mr. Lay: I am a former Enron employee.
I used to be proud of Enron.
I believed everything that you and EES management said.
I believe that the Vision and Values that you and other senior executives at Enron preached are not worth the paper they are printed on.
Respect, Integrity, Communication, Excellence.
I don't believe you respected the rights of so many Enron employees who sacrificed their family time so that the company would succeed.
I don't believe you have any integrity when it comes to fully disclosing Enron's future.
You obviously have not communicated the truth to employees, analysts or anyone else.
Maybe you should look inside yourself to see if you have the excellence now that you demanded from your employees.
I would like to see you take ownership of the incredible debacle that has fallen upon Enron.
So many of my friends and colleagues are out of work because of the gross mismanagement that you and others have shown.
I believe the least you could do is go on record and address these people at a time of year that is so special to so many.
Do the right thing and show some of the visions and values that you spoke so highly of not so long ago.
Show the men and women of Enron and Houston what you're all about.

Crystal Ballroom holds salsa classes on the first Tuesday of every month.
The hour-long class begins at 7p.m., with live music and dancing afterward.
Cost is $8 for the whole evening.
The other Tuesdays of the month have live music and dancing, and sometimes classes too.
Anyway, I'm sure it won't take us more than an hour to become master Latin dancers on par with Ricky Martin and Christina Aguilera.
Do you want to try it out?
Next class is Jan. 23.
And there is actually a salsa event going on at the Crystal this Friday night with bands and dancing and all kinds of mayhem - it's $12 and doors open at 7 p.m. Mark your calendars and tell all your coordinated (and/or good-looking) friends to come along.

However, if you are not employed by UBS, you remain an Enron employee.
If you have specific questions regarding your employment arrangements and job responsibilities please contact Anne Labbe in Human Resources at 5-7809, or feel free to contact either Jim Fallon or Dave Delainey directly.

Please note that there is a new deal entered today to transfer the BOM portion of the UAMPS deal from LT-SW to ST-WR per Matt's request.
The deal details are: Index-Option: 807382.1 Term: 10/8/01 - 10/31/01 (we use the same method to pick the hours as we use for the CSU option) The MTM value calculated from this deal for ST-WR is $30,685.
For Monday strip: Index-Forward: 807382.2 Term: 10/8/01 - 10/8/01 HE 11 - 10mws HE 12-14 - 25mws per Holden.
The BOM strips for the index-option deal #804470 in LT-SW have been zeroed out.
An annuity deal #807428 was entered for the difference between $2.5 MM (per Matt) and $30,685 = $2,469,315, for LT-SW Buy from ST-WR.
Please let me know if you have any questions.

Dear NewCo employees: =20 I wanted to send a note giving you my views on the NewCo opportunity and ne= xt steps.=20 =20 What are those opportunities?
In short, to date no competitor has taken En= ron's dominant market position.
In most cases, competitiors are retrenchin= g from an aggressive expansion of their deregulated business in order to pr= otect their key regulated franchises or balance sheets.
Market liquidity an= d activity is extremely fractured and highly diminished from 2000 levels.
= This will create opportunities as bid/offers expand and customers have less= choices to manage key long-term risks.
This lack of transparancy and liqui= dity will also provide numerous opportunities, in the commodity, asset and = capital markets, to take advantage of key arbitrages across the North Ameri= can grid.
We are faced with an energy asset overhang, in the short run, w= hich is unprecedented since the early nineties.
This coupled with market p= articipants selling assets to protect balance sheets will provide many oppo= rtunities to acquire attractive energy assets at good value.
However, in th= e long-run, as we emerge from the recession and as highly energy intensive = technology investment resumes, increasing asset values, demand for energy a= nd energy price volatility are highly likely.
On the services side, there a= re numerous un-met needs in the market place at this point including demand= side management, distributed generation amongst others that only Enron peo= ple have the complete value chain understanding to make feasible.
I also be= lieve that innovation in the energy capital markets can provide value to Ne= wCo and our customers given the blight of liquidity in capital markets.
In = short, we are at the eve of an opportunity in the energy markets which has = not been seen since the early nineties.
=20 What is NewCo?
NewCo will be a private company that will focus on the ener= gy merchant business in North America which will capitalize on the opportun= ities detailed above.
These businesses will stretch from production to mar= ket, wholesale through retail primarily in natural gas and electricity in t= he United States and Canada.
It will be a portfolio of several key business= es, services and assets supported by a common infrastructure.

Welcome to Enron Center South.
As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here.
We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks.
Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.
NEC Monitors The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.
Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.
Turret Users An "Alliance MX turret quick reference guide" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as "Caller ID" and "Voicemail Indication".
Increased Information Access There are many NEC 50" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.
While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.
The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.
Here's how: Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.
The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.
To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below: Channel Avaya Stentophon Weather Channel 12401 801 CNN Headlines News 12402 802 CNN Financial News 12403 803 CNBC 12404 804 MSNBC 12405 805 Bloomberg 12406 806 Financial News Network 12407 807 CNN 12408 808 Fox Sports 12409 809 ESPN1 12410 810 Wireless Telephony You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.
We are implementing a multi-network "in-building" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.
Wireless LAN The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested.
We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.
Amtel Replacement As a move to provide a more flexible "Plug n Play" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging.
The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software

I will then expect my group to contact you before they leave at night if it is above or below your estimates, or range you give them.
This will certainly help us all avoid any fire drills the next day.
If you have any concerns about this please let me know, otherwise, your book admins will be calling you or stopping by your desks around 3:00 daily to get this estimate.

As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.
The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.
Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.
Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.
But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.
Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.
However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.
Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.
I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.
But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.
I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.
Thank you.

We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.
To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from 0900 to 1100 (CST).
It is planned to include all traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.
Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our "live" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will: Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions: Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups: Profile tests for "external" customers (role-played by Originators) Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems Traders and Originators: Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products.
Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation.
Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties.
Credit limits, etc.
will be tested during the simulation.
Information Technology: Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.
Next steps Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles.
You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.
Summary This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business.
We appreciate

FYI - Beth Apollo led the doorstep review in Monterrey last week.
No problems discovered - but Beth did find some communications and system access issues that could be improved to make it easier for Max's team to do their jobs.
She has quickly identified a point person within Operations in Houston who is bi-lingual (Gordon).
Max's note addresses his pleasure over Beth's responsiveness and the doorstep process in general.

Can you clarify for me how the agency fee is suppose to be calculated?
I am getting mixed information.
I know that we use the higher of the two volumes (receipts vs. deliveries).
The question is do we use the nom volume or the actual volume.
Last month (March), we left the volume at the nom of 45,000/day.
In the past , we have changed the volume to the actual daily volume.
For April, the actuals are higher than the nom and we would need to bump the volume up to 47,089/day.
James Armstrong is using the actual volume.
The deal for the fee is 514353.
My other problem is that the spreadsheet is choosing the max of three volumes, receipts, deliveries and transport.
Should the transport volume be in the calculation?
Also, Mark added some payback volume to the spreadsheet and it is being included in the receipt volume.
Do I include the payback volume in the calculation of the agency fee if we use the nom?
If you have a copy of the contract that addresses the agency fee, I would like to have a copy.
You can fax it to 713-571-3141.
If none of this makes sense, give me a call and I can try and explain further.
Thanks,

WARNING: Laptop AC Adapter Recall Program This recall and replacement program only affects AC adapters on laptop systems with the listed Model Series Number (second list below), not the notebook computers themselves.
We ask that all laptop users in the ETS environment check the number on their AC adapter, and notify us by return email if any of the three model series numbers appear just under the COMPAQ COMPUTER CORPORATION name.
We will centrally manage the replacement of your adapter to insure the replacement adapter is ordered and installed.
In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, Compaq Computer Corporation announced a worldwide voluntary recall and replacement program for approximately 1.4 million AC adapters used with certain commercial notebook computer products.
Compaq customers affected by this recall and replacement program will be eligible to receive a replacement AC adapter for each recalled adapter.
These AC adapters were distributed worldwide in notebooks, as separate options, and as replacement spares for the following notebooks: ?
Armada M300 ?
Armada 100s ?
Armada M700 ?
Armada 110 ?
Armada E500 ?
Prosignia 170 ?
Armada E500s ?
Prosignia 190 ?
Armada V300 ?
Notebook 100 ?
Armada 3500 This recall and replacement program involves AC adapters made by only one of the multiple manufacturers used by Compaq; thus, not every notebook computer listed above will be affected by the recall.
The affected AC adapters can be identified by the adapter Model Series Number located directly under the Compaq Computer Corporation name on the AC adapter label.

Just in case you're checking your e-mail in between spa sessions, here's an update: The BPA Business Plan has not yet arrived.
Sir Speedy just arrived with copies of the EIS, which were supposed to be finished at noon.
So I'm a little frustrated with this lack of efficiency.
I've left a message at BPA regarding the whereabouts of our order; I've scolded Sir Speedy for the delay; and one way or another I'll get the documents out to Terrell Gault and Jim Fell tomorrow.
I'm sure the last thing you want to hear while you're escaping from it all is that things aren't going according to planned back in the office; but I thought you should know just in case you hear from either of these guys.
Nothing to worry about, though.

Several changes have been made to Stack Manager and the website.
These changes are outlined below and will be visible by all as of Monday September 3, 2001.
Stack Manager Changes Activate/Inactivate Stack - This functionality allows the trader to pull a product's prices from the website without suspending the product.
If the Top of Stack limit order functionality is activated for a particular product this should be used to pull the stack prices from the website without pulling the entire product; therefore, if there are top of stack limit orders against the product they will remain visible and transactable on the website.
If a product's stack is inactivated the font for that product will be grayed out in stack manager.
If the stack is active it will appear in black font.
To use this feature, select the product, right click and choose "Inactivate Stack".
When you are ready to reactivate your prices, select the same product, right click again and choose "Activate Stack".
There are also icons on the tool bar at the top of your screen which will Activate/Inactivate the stack of the highlighted product.
See screen shot below for the icons.
Changes to Product Properties - Currently when modifications are made to certain properties within the product properties screen, the product will be suspended and pulled from the website.
Now instead of being suspended, the product's stack will become inactive.
Once the changes have been made and saved to the properties of a product simply click the Activate Stack icon as discussed above.
Website Change Restrictions on Top of Stack orders - If Top of Stack limit orders are allowed on a product, but the trader is not showing both a bid and offer, limit orders will not be able to be placed on that product.
If you have any questions please call me at 31787.
Thanks.

Greetings from the land of watery-eyed, flat-assed office workers!
How goes the burly mountain man thing?
I've been hearing second hand from Elliot that you're faring extremely well mentally despite some poorly crafted sleeping bags and a bad case of frostbite on your toes.
(That second part I made up, but it sounded appropriate given the sleeping bag situation.)
All's well here.
As you could imagine, and probably often do, the sweeping expanse of people staring at computers that is Enron has changed not at all since you left.
There are still many computers, many of them have changed positions, some have gone away, most we are not sad to see go.
That's just the nature of this cutthroat business.
Also on the stagnantly invariable list is the status of my life in relation to Enron.
I am still here.
I still stare at the computer.
Every once in awhile I meander over to the dark window-less corner that enshrouds the IT wizards and ask them silly questions like, "What does it mean when I hit this button and my screen starts flashing at me like a disco ball, then makes this awkward shrieking noise and finally goes black?"
They are incredibly helpful.
I am still pretty much clueless about most things, although I've learned to talk about them with a semblance of authority, as in, "No, you twit, the 25 megawatt off peak deal should clearly be flowing across SP-15 to NP-15 because of the illiquidity of SP's market right now.
What kind of idiot wouldn't hedge their position in California at a time like this?"
It all sounds very exotic and important to me, which is why I'm still here.
But I'm infinitely jealous of your wild exploits in the great American outdoors.
I suspect my forbearance for sitting in an office will run out right around the middle of the summer, so I'm planning a trip to coincide with that meltdown.
I haven't decided between a road trip through the western United States or just a direct flight to Paris.
Both sound good, and way beyond my budget, therefore equally attractive.
Well, I've managed to say practically nothing for long enough now.
I do hope you're having an amazing time, rambling on toward the next crazy adventure on the horizon as I believe Jack Kerouac once wrote.

Tom, Here are the new graphs with totals (bar charts) and distributions (boxplots) for all seven sites through May 2002.
I believe that I have come up with a method of providing you with the ESTIMATED energy lost.
Since it requires using two data sets (faults and 10-minute data) it will be take a bit longer to run.
However I hope to have that result to you next week.

So what's happening today?
Are you involved in ranking stuff, like Kim?
That's all so much fun.
I think Armin and I should have a ranking meeting, he would get some low marks in the courteous office behavior..when he gets stressed he turns into...ISOLDE!!!!
Maybe if I threaten his bonus he would work to improve that one little imperfection.
And of course I need no improvement in ANY catagory, I'm just perfect (I'm sure he will agree..ha ha haaaa).
Angus would get the best rating from both of us, he is perfect in our eyes.
I think Angus may be in trouble with the workers though...i let him out to do his business while ago and the workers had their lunches sitting out, I'm afraid to ask them if he helped himself to their food...he's really bad about that!
He got on my desk one afternoon while Armin and I were outside and dined on some M&M's that were in a cup on my desk...there were only like 5 in the cup and when we came back in, I found one partially licked one on my desk and one on Armin's...of course he was sick that night.
We are finally getting warmer wetter again, oops that's weather in english.
I was able to take off my coat at lunch time, hopefully tomorrow the thermals can go too.
I hope Julie has been having better weather in Prague...but I think not.
Have ya'll heard from her?
I thought she might call us since she's on the continent... Did you tell her about talking to your parents?
She told me that she told you her secret.
Were you surprised?
I actually guess who it was, but I was surprised!
Last I heard she didn't know their status....did she ever find out?

Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol "ENRNQ."
This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.
Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.
The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.
Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.
Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC "Pink Sheets."

Thursday December 20 5:39 AM ET Bids Open for Enron Trading Unit By KRISTEN HAYS, Associated Press Writer HOUSTON (AP) - A U.S. bankruptcy judge has set in motion the bidding process for embattled Enron Corp.'s once-dominant trading operation, which some Wall Streets insiders say could fetch up to $1 billion.
Enron said at a hearing Wednesday before Judge Arthur Gonzalez in New York that it would allow parties to bid for all or part of the wholesale trading unit.
Enron lawyer Martin J. Bienenstock said none of the 14 potential bidders to come forward so far have expressed interest in bidding for Enron's book of contracts, which Enron values at $5 billion to $7 billion.
Bids are due Jan. 7; an auction will be held Jan. 10.
Bienenstock said bidders are wary of the potential liabilities in the contracts and that the short time frame does not allow for a full review of the books.
The company, however, wants to complete the auction as soon as possible to avoid losing traders to other financial companies.
In Enron's home base of Houston Wednesday, a federal judge ruled that a state court should decide whether Enron must give rival Dynegy Inc. a key natural gas pipeline.
Dynegy claims Enron signed away its right to Northern Natural Gas Co. pipeline, a prized 16,500-mile system running between Texas and the Midwest, in exchange for $1.5 billion invested in Enron before a proposed merger of the two competitors collapsed in late November.
Enron claims its smaller rival illegally terminated the $8.4 billion deal and therefore has no right to the pipeline.
Enron and had argued that Dynegy's claim should be part of Enron's massive bankruptcy case filed in federal court in New York.
U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon ruled that Dynegy's suit should be heard in state court because the company's claim was not a core element of the bankruptcy.
Harmon noted that Dynegy could have sued Enron if the former energy giant didn't seek Chapter 11 protection.
 ⁇ It's what we predicted,'' said David Burns, a lawyer representing Dynegy in the lawsuit.
 ⁇ If we don't have Northern Natural Gas turned over to us promptly, we will ask the court to provide an accelerated trial date on this.''
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne declined comment on the decision.
Dynegy sued Enron in Texas state court in Houston the day after

I have been updated by Susan on her (largely futile) efforts to push ECS on the $200k we think they owe us.
Martha, please get me a half hour Tuesday with Susan, James and Kevin so we can decide how to get closure on this.
If I understand ECS' position, their argument is that CDEC stonewalled and delayed granting access to the critical website and therefore its not ECS' fault that manual peak monitoring wasn't operational until December .
That argument, it seems to me, is BS because we never heard even a shred of warning or request for help from ECS on getting things moving, right?
At minimum, TW could have raised holy hell with TriState and CDEC management to get things moving if we knew that ECS was stymied.
But we heard nothing.
Is that our story?
If its going to take me doing some yelling at Knippa or Steve and Rod talking to Redmond, lets decide what the script is and get it done.

David, This one is very similar to the one you just did.
In fact, the data is almost identical.
We download power plant outage data from the California ISO website (manual until you guys get some free time to set up an automated scrape).
Anyway, the data gets into an Access database of mine in a table with key fields: Date and Res Name.
The other fields include Type (planned or unplanned), Owner, Location, plant capacity, and of course, the quantity of the outage.
So, we need basically the large table as the one you did which lists each plant and the outage for "today" and let's say 1 week in the past.
We cannot go in the future because the data gets posted daily for that day only.
Then the other table will just summarize the total "Planned" and "Unplanned" by region.
A copy of the database is attached.
Let me know when you have a chance to start working on it.
Thanks.

The merger agreement with Dynegy provides that subs of Dynegy merger with Enron with Enron being the surviving corporation.
Enron and Dynegy then would be subs of a newly incorporated holding company.
It might be more advantageous for a variety of reasons to do a structure in which Enron mergers with the ultimate publicly traded company (whether existing Dynegy or a new holding company) with that publicly traded company being the nominal survivor.
Under Delaware, Oregon, and most other states' law, the surviving company automatically would assume all of Enron's obligations as a matter of law, and the merger agreement would so provide if this structure were used.
Could you review the various change-of-control provisions that you've previoulsy identified to see if this structure--with Enron not being the technical survivor of the merger--makes any difference to your conclusions about whether those provisions would be triggered?
Please respond to Rob Walls, Lance Schuler, Joe Henry, Peter del Vecchio and me.

Hi, Sweethearts, I want to let you know that Michael's father passed away yesterday morning.
He had been feeling bad for about a month and last week he passed out and hurt himself.
At the hospital they found out that he had a bleeding ulcer that made him faint.
They took had to take him off the blood thinners and they were giving him medication for the ulcer and sent him home Tuesday night.
Wednesday morning he must have had a blood clot that caused a heart attack.
Crystal and Jamie did cpr which started his heart again but then it stopped.
Michael is in Denver and is going to Alamo tonight for the funeral on Saturday.
The kids and I aren't going since Michael has to leave for Denver and then North Dakota on Sunday and he doesn't want me trying to drive out there alone with the kids.
Michael was training on Wednesday so I waited to tell him until lunch.
He is blessed that two of his good friends were there and they have helped him deal with his loss (one of them is exactly Michael's age and is dying of lymphoma...he has 5 children, the youngest just 7).
Michael seems to be doing fine, although the funeral will be hard.
His family will be in a financial crisis, though.
Please pray with us for them that God helps them through their pain and hard decisions.
Mandi, I hope your move goes without problems.
I love you all,

The particulars of the transaction: We are obligated to deliver 25 MW of power to WALC at Pinnacle Peak through 12/31/04.
The company receives $45 for each MW delivered to WALC.
Pinnacle Peak is not a liquid trading hub.
There are only two utilities with facilities at Pinnacle Peak, WALC and APS.
We are currently utilizing APS transmission to deliver energy to WALC during off peak hours.
The cost of the APS transmission is $1.95.
The energy to satisfy this obligation is available at Four Corners under contract from El Paso Electric.
The energy from El Paso is contracted to be purchased through the end of this year under a prepetition agreement at a fixed price of $22.25.
The Transmission Service Agreement will be terminated by APS for nonpayment of a prepetition obligation of $43,708.60.
APS is the sole party able to provide transmission to Pinnacle Peak at this time.
Absent the ability to purchase transmission from APS, the company will be forced to settle the WALC obligation at above market prices due to the illiquidity at Pinnacle Peak.
These costs could run as high as $5.
The inablity to purchase APS transmission for $1.95 will increase the company's costs by as much as $3 over the term of the WALC obligation.
There are approximately 95,000 MWh remaining to be delivered to WALC for the remainder of 2001 on light load hours.
The increased cost to deliver would result in an additional expense of $285,000 for the remaining deliveries this year.
The increased cost for the entire term of the WALC agreement could exceed $1,000,000.

He will be moving to Columbus, Ohio where he will not personally know anyone locally to hire.
He does know these risk specialists here, and being young and single or childless, their mobility factors could be high.
Enron would not want to lose any other talent to Steve's new employer.

Oh my gosh!
Just found out right after I got off the phone with you that I am no longer going to see Madonna.
We couldn't give the guy a definite yes and he had to go ahead and sell the tickets.
Yikes.
I think I am going to kill myself.
Was it bad luck talking with you??
Ha!

Anyway, I enjoyed talking with you!

On Sunday, the new Fortune magazine was a roadway for my two-year old's cars.
On Monday, my sixteen year-old used the cover to cut out pictures of money for a school project.
Last night, the magazine made it into my hands around midnight when everything at home was settled in for the night.
What a nice article!
I smiled while reading it.
How nice to see your accomplishments recognized in print.
Congratulations.
I hope that you have plenty of copies for your mom and dad.

Credit cards that is!
- I just requested another $50 Macy's GC - this is still the best reward that they have (we have another 2,500 points already).
Also, I straightened up the deal with AT&T Long distance and they are going to correct the bill to $33.23 and starting with the next bill we are supposed to get 120 minutes a month of free long distance so talk up.
Also, two other things - I checked BofA and the Negril pulse came through as $142.09 and also I was looking at the AT&T credit card and it had a charge for $117.50 from Chi's cakes and more.
I guess that is just the charge for the cake but wanted to make sure the it wasn't for the cake stands.
Since we are both big rich types you want to go to dinner tonight?
Let me know.

Attached please find the corporate allocations for the 2002 fiscal year that EIM will accept.
After unsuccessfully attempting to get some justification for the PROPOSED allocations from many of the various corporate groups, we have had to make a determination ourselves as to what we believe are reasonable charges for the value received from these groups.
This determination was based on several factors including, 2001 actual allocations, expected services provided to EIM, redundant services provided by other groups that are also performed at EIM, etc.
The attached charges are acceptable to EIM and will be used in the budget presentation to the office of the chair unless the allocating groups can come to an agreement with Kent Castleman of EIM as to a revision of these charges before such meeting.

Adele: Tanya left a message for Cindy and offerred $10M as a cap for each Guaranty.
The reason for the cushion is to protect the party who terminates at a time when its exposure is close to the credit threshold and by the time that the date is set and the amount is calculated there is a move in the market that results in its exposure being above the threshold.

We barricaded as much of it as we could and the UCPD and the Fire Department responded to our call.
We quickly discovered that the white powder was plain flour that had been placed in Haas and across campus by a student Ping Pong club on a cross campus footrace.
The student group is in the processing of cleaning up all of the piles of white powder.
If you find any piles in the building that were missed, please let us know so that we can get it all cleaned up right away.

HEADLINE: ?Calif.
Governor To Address State BYLINE: JENNIFER COLEMAN DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif.
BODY: ??
?While Gov.
Gray Davis prepared to speak to the state Thursday night about California's energy crisis, economic forecasters predicted the power crunch would lead to higher taxes and scrapped public projects.
?
?Davis said Wednesday he hadn't written his five-minute address, but that he planned to discuss ''the progress that we've made and what we have to get through.''
?
?Among other things, he was expected to talk about the more than 40 percent rate increases approved last week by the Public Utilities Commission for customers of the state's two largest utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison Co.
He has asked California television stations to carry his remarks live.
?
?California has been hit with rolling blackouts and tight power supplies blamed in part on soaring wholesale electricity costs.
?
?On Wednesday, the state got more bad economic news: The UCLA Anderson Business Forecast said Californians would face higher taxes and a tighter state budget because of the billions of state dollars being spent on emergency power.
The blackouts and the state's scrutiny of private power suppliers also threaten to scare away new businesses, the report said.
?
?Facing continued refusal from federal energy regulators to cap high energy prices, Davis said Wednesday he would be willing to support a windfall-profits tax on electric generators that have made a fortune selling power to California this year.
?
?A bill to that effect was introduced Wednesday in the state Assembly.
It would tax gross receipts that ''significantly exceed'' the cost of producing power and tax profits of power marketers who have bought power and later sold it at much higher rates.
??
''We continue to allow some electricity generators and middlemen to reap enormous profits on their sales of electricity into the state.
This profiteering must stop,'' Democratic Assemblywoman Ellen Corbett said.
?
?Duke Energy spokesman Tom Williams said he doubted a tax on a selected industry would be legal.
He added that such a tax would discourage generators from building new power plants in California.
??
''The governor has made very clear that he is trying to do whatever he can to increase the amount of generation in California and reduce the price.
Windfall-profits taxes do neither of these,'' Williams said.

John, I plan to speak with Sequent by the end of this week to inform them if we are interested in returning the assets to them and if so under what structure.
I have checked with Cris Sherman and others in Accounting, they have determined that the "East Desk" does not have to accelerate the payment of its "debt" to John Arnold's book if we get out of the Hopewell transaction.
That being said, you were checking on the real $$$ exposure to retaining the Hopewell deal past the VNG transaction.
The way we are currently booked we are not interested in restructuring the VNG/Hopwell arrangement.
If on the other hand we see real $$$ exposure, this is the perfect time to try to combine the VNG restructuring with the Hopwell exposure.
I need to understand our position this week if possible.

Clint, Per our discussions, we need to agree to some modifications to the confirmation this week in order to proceed with the roll.
These modifications involve making sure we can receive the cash due to us if you net share settle, and should not impact your accounting for the transactions.
This clauses are standard - I'm not sure how they got dropped from the confirmation.
Here is a blackline version of the confirm:  ⁇ Enron confirm blackline 9-26-01.doc>> Best regards,

Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued.
Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering.
The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation.
However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company.
I will keep you updated on developments as they occur.

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.
We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.
Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.
In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.
Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.
In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.
It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.
To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.
If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).
Thank you for your help in this matter.

Dawn has given us until noon Wednesday to get them the final list of EOL products and book mappings.
I know with the trader changes last Friday these will change again.
The traders had a meeting this morning going over their curves, and it sounds like they are moving some curves between regions and might possibly be losing some locations.
Since we will be testing everything on Thursday, we need to have our curve files ready to load on Wednesday to give a prior day curve for portcalc.
The west traders are looking at theirs now, can you guys check with your traders and see if they need any changes made to the files, and let them change any links?
We also need to create a curve file that the traders can get to, but doesn't give them access to any of our other files, so the current location will not be the final.
We can create this tomorrow once we have converted over to UBS.

Thanks to each of you who help in the review process yesterday.
As many of you know, we found that several of the contracts that we reviewed did reconcile with the Total Exposure (in other words, the agreements were not the right ones).
Eric Moon and Russell Diamond are working with IT, Credit and Risk to access deal specific information in a way that will let us link deal numbers to contract numbers.
Thereafter we can get the right agreements and finish the process.
I will update you later today on the status.

I am disappointed that Joe Grundfest will not be able to join us at our next Advisory Council meeting.
However Tom Campbell sounds like an excellent alternative.
Would you please contact him and see if he might be willing to join us for the next meeting and talk about the subjects you suggested.
Incidentally, we're happy to pay an honorarium to any of our guest speakers.
I think I should pass at this time on inviting Spence Abraham to join us for dinner.
First, I believe it would be virtually impossible for him to do that at this point in time.
But second, many people are already blaming me for being the real energy policy maker in the new Administration and I would just as soon not feed that speculation.

Please be aware that the last leg of transmission listed on tag #28010 is a dummy leg of transmission that needs to be placed on the tag in order to reflect Valley Electrics Load at Mead 230.
We use this dummy leg of transmission because Valley Electric does not have a PSE acronym in the OATI tagging system.
We have been creating tags such as this since the OATI tagging system has been in use and have not or should not be getting charged for using NEVP trani.
Please refer to the following tag numbers as examples: 22655, 22654, 26279, 26387.
Please note that each of these tags was approved by NEVP the control area and NEVP the transmission provider and therefore has been implemented.
It was our understanding that this was a practice agreed upon by NEVP and Enron in order to reflect Valley Electrics load at Mead.
My contact at Nevp is Jannella Battles.
Please, keep me in the loop as to what the result of this issue will be.
Thanks,

She is expecting to get her H-1 visa anytime, and wants to make sure that she receives it.
Should we have her contact Tindall & Foster directly?
Also, by law, when an individual on an H-1b visa is terminated, the company is required to provide them a one way ticket back to their home country.
Does that still apply in a bankruptcy?
If so, who will be handling those arrangements?

Parties represented at an informal meeting after the February 7, 2000 prehearing conference discussed circulating redlined versions of the CAC settlement proposal as a point of departure for further settlement conferences.
Transwestern Pipeline Company submits the following comments in lieu of a redlined document.
Transwestern fully supports the CAC's proposal of a path-defined receipt point structure that would define primary and secondary rights at receipt points on the SoCalGas system.
Not only does the proposal satisfy the Commission's requirement that Hector Road be established as a formal receipt point, it is also consistent with open and non-discriminatory access and use of the SoCalGas system, and will help provide a reasonable degree of certainty so that all market participants can more effectively plan gas transportation.
CAC's proposed receipt point principles ensure that no upstream transportation provider will unduly be denied access to SoCal's system.
Transwestern believes that the parties may still need to address certain details regarding implementation of the receipt point proposal that have not been fully described in the CAC document.
To this end, Transwestern proposes that implementation of the receipt point proposal be included on the agenda for the upcoming all-party settlement discussions.
Transwestern looks forward to a constructive discussion of the proposal and is confident that the parties will be able to agree on a plan for implementation.

Dear Mr. Lay: You may not actually take time to read this email, but it will make me feel better having sent it.
I started with Enron 2 1/2 years ago in the ENA Volume Management Group.
Even after having 3 managers in the group, my reviews were outstanding, and after 1 1/2 years in the group, I decided to spread my wings.
I wanted to make a difference at Enron and I decided to take a position with Enron Global Markets, a growing and prosperous group at the time.
Once again, I was passed around through various managers, 3 to be exact, however I still received outstanding reviews.
With all of my reviews, always came the promise of being promoted with the next one.
However, with the last mid-year review, my boss knew that the time had come - but he encouraged me to wait until year-end, as my raise and bonus would be much better that way.
I knew that he was looking out for my best interest, as I am sure the other 5 managers had done along the way as well.
Unfortunately, the company took a turn for the worse and I could soon see that my future with this company that I sincerely loved was coming to an end.
I was one of the lucky ones, as I was not severed.
I knew that since I was a ???survivor??
?, all the hard work had been recognized and that is why I was considered a ??
?critical employee???.
But the longer I stayed, the more the uncertainty of the company became abundantly apparent to me and I knew I needed to do something to protect my career and myself.
I decided to seek employment outside of Enron.
I was fortunate.
I found something immediately.
I honestly believe it was because of my experience at Enron, along with having some of the best mangers and directors as mentors, that I was able to find such an opportunity.
I knew that the day would come that I would have to give notice, but I was hoping and praying that Enron Management would not do me wrong, as so many of my friends had been.
I knew that Enron would be fair and pay me my three weeks of vacation that I was due.
I was mistaken.
When it all came down to it, Enron in the end looked out for itself.
After receiving the run around, I was eventually told that I would not receive any of my vacation, although the rules had never been revised from previous years and nothing

Hello.
The west gas desk would like to send a mailout to our EOL customers regarding the new opportunity to trade "odd lots" on every physical product.
EOL has been instrumental in providing liquidity to previously illiquid physical delivery points in the west for standard volumes of 5000 mmbtu/d and greater, but we would like to notify our customers that EOL will now accommodate odd size lots, in 1 mmbtu increments.
This will allow us to trade the "non-standard" volumes with all of the market.
Do we have a creative team that might be able to assist us in our efforts?
We were thinking about a one page mailout with a clear message.
We would like it to be very upbeat and funny.

Welcome to Enron Center South.
As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here.
We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks.
Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.
NEC Monitors The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.
Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.
Turret Users An "Alliance MX turret quick reference guide" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as "Caller ID" and "Voicemail Indication".
Increased Information Access There are many NEC 50" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.
While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.
The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.
Here's how: Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.
The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.
To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below: Channel Avaya Stentophon Weather Channel 12401 801 CNN Headlines News 12402 802 CNN Financial News 12403 803 CNBC 12404 804 MSNBC 12405 805 Bloomberg 12406 806 Financial News Network 12407 807 CNN 12408 808 Fox Sports 12409 809 ESPN1 12410 810 Wireless Telephony You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.
We are implementing a multi-network "in-building" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.
Wireless LAN The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested.
We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.
Amtel Replacement As a move to provide a more flexible "Plug n Play" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging.
The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software

Business/Financial Desk; Section C Enron Tries To Dismiss Finance Doubts By FLOYD NORRIS 10/24/2001 The New York Times Page 1, Column 5 c. 2001 New York Times Company Enron has ample access to cash, the company's chief executive said yesterday as he assured investors that there was no need for additional write-offs stemming from unusual financing activities.
In a conference call with investors that was hastily scheduled after Enron's stock plunged on Monday, the chief executive, Kenneth W. Lay, strongly defended the company's chief financial officer and said there was no conflict of interest involved in transactions that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into.
But he refused to go into detail on the transaction that Enron made with partnerships run by Andrew S. Fastow, the chief financial officer.
In addition, Mr. Fastow, while declaring that Enron ''expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations,'' declined to answer any questions about it.
The conference call, which began just as trading opened on the New York Stock Exchange, at first seemed to be reassuring investors.
Within minutes of the beginning of the call, the share price rallied to $23.25.
But it soon began falling, and ended the day down 86 cents, at $19.79.
The day's low of $19.62 was the lowest since Jan. 12, 1998, and was down 78 percent from the high set by the stock in the summer of 2000.
Until recently, most investors focused on the company's reported operating earnings, which showed good results as it became a leading player in energy markets.
But the focus has shifted to a series of transactions, some involving off-balance-sheet financing.
One, involving partnerships controlled by Mr. Fastow, led to a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity that raised concern last week and led to S.E.C.
inquiries that the company disclosed on Monday.
One of the company's strongest supporters has been David Fleischer, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs.
But he told Mr. Lay on the call yesterday that Enron had to be more forthcoming with information.
''There is an appearance that you are hiding something,'' he said.
After the call, Mr. Fleischer expressed disappointment.
''They've engaged in a number of transactions that one wonders about, and that are hard to understand,'' he said in an interview.
''They have not been as forthcoming in explaining them'' as is

Guys, it is my understanding that the incremental $5 MM in gas V@R, under an interim authority, expires today.
Given current market conditions, I would request an extension of that interim limit - $45MM in total gas V@R for an additional two weeks starting today.
Jeff, as per our meeting today, we may want to think about additional permanent increases for gas and power V@R particularily given the Alberta PPA's, the potential NStar deal and the current gas market as we enter the winter season.
I will take your lead on this one.

Attached is a draft letter setting forth Enron's damages in connection with the termination of certain commodity forward and swap positions with PG&E.
In lieu of sending out multiple letters and then aggregating the exposures for set off purposes, I thought it would be more understandable if we put all the matters in one letter.
For each product line, I thought we could attach all the relevant information (I'm not sure if this is making it too easy for the court but it seems like the right thing to do).
Each commodity line then would assemble the following and attach as an Appendix to the letter: 1.
Copy of Master Contract or applicable GTC 2.
Copy of transaction confirmations 3.
Copy of termination notice sent to PG&E 4.
Chart summarizing key commercial terms of transaction(s) 5.
Chart summarizing unpaid receivables and invoices for same 6.
Chart setting forth termination payment calculation for each terminated trade 7.
Paragraph describing methodology used to determine termination payment valuation (eg - 4 quotes secured, threw out high and low and averaged middle) 8 List showing quotes secured (entity, person, time and amount) and the extent available, written confirmation of such quote I will be out of the office the rest of this week but will organize a call for early next week in order to finalize the PG&E package.
Thanks for all your help.

Tammy, Attached is the Latest EOP's Headcount & TradeFloor Count to be Placed In the Headcount list I have highlighted in red any changes to headcount and comments that were affected.
If I only changed an employee name and the headcount # did not change I did not highlight it.
I also added a Grand Total without HPL Employees (those that are tranferring to AEP).
I will be forwarding the EOP's Headcount 5.3 attachment to Sally's direct reports and will forward a revision as necessary.
For those employees yet to be placed we have Gas Logistics employees that were not included with their groups per Ina's list and this will be necessary.
We also need to meet with Sally again to discuss even further priority to be given to a couple of other groups that need to be on the trade floor with the Traders and Gas Logistics Schedulers (i.e., Transport Rate, Risk Mgmt) Please let me know if there is anything I can help you with.

Attached is a preliminary draft of a filing for capacity options on Transwestern.
The attachments include a filing letter, proposed tariff language and a proposed form agreement.
Obviously there are still quite a few details to be worked out.
I am distributing a draft at this early stage in hopes of initiating a dialogue about the larger issues first.
A few that come to mind are whether we want to commit to selling options online, how best to explain or justify the option fee, and what specifically in the industry has changed such that FERC should depart from existing policy and allow TW to essentially reserve future capacity for shippers.
Please let me know your thoughts on these and any other issues.
I would prefer to wait to discuss comments on wording, other conforming changes to the tariff, and other comments concerning form until after we have resolved the substantive issues.
Thanks.

Just to alert you.
The new CPUC proposed decision to suspend DA to be voted on next week has some language of concern and I wanted you to be aware of it This new language, which was circulated today, implies some retroactive action by the CPUC -- but not on the suspension issue.
So, some financial risk is possible.
The language follows.
We will endeavor to get the language removed (long-shot) or clarified (also long-shot).

Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats.
The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com.
We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname).
Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format.
It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com.
For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards.
If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks.
Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format.
If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Heart disease is the number one killer, but great strides have been made in the last fifty years.
Dr. DeBakey designed the first revolutionary procedure on his wife's sewing machine, and today, right on CNN, we can see the first human walking around with a completely artificial heart.
Many of you know someone who wouldn't be here without these advancements in medical technology.
On Saturday, November 3, Enron and other companies will be joining the American Heart Association for the Heart Walk.
The Houston Heart Walk is targeting over $750,000 for continuing the fight against heart disease and for rebuilding the many years of research that were lost as a result of this year's floods.
We are looking for 50 team captains.
The primary role of a team captain is to recruit approximately ten walkers.
The walkers can be friends, family, business associates outside Enron, or co-workers.
The walkers, in turn, solicit sponsors for the walk.
As a team captain, you may also walk, of course, and Enron's top walker (from a fundraising perspective) is eligible for two free airline tickets.
Additional incentives are currently being developed.
If you are willing to serve as a team captain or a walker, please email or call Sue Wadsworth (713-853-5105) or Melissa Becker (713-853-6641).
We look forward to seeing you November 3 and demonstrating Enron's commitment to fighting heart disease.

Item One The Frontera Plant is scheduled to sell 450 mw's for tomorrow.
I sold them a financial swap @ $24 for the whole day.
For the first part of the day we will be running extremely short.
We will just that we are having problems coming up.
This is the amount that will be short: he7 - 420 mw's he 8 - 420 mw's he 9 - 420 mw's he 10 - 315 mw's he 11 - 230 mw's he 12 - 22 100 mw's I would like you to buy power for 7-11 for alot less than $24.
If you cant, then we will take the imbalance price.
If you do buy, purchase under the Ercot Asset book and schedule to South Zone load for the Ercot Asset book.
If you have questions, call me.
Item Two I purchased 99 mw's from City of Austin for tomorrow, hours ending 7-22 under the Ercot Asset book.
I sold this power to the ST ERCOT desk for $28.75.
This power can be rescinded intraday.
WE NEED TO CALL CITY OF AUSTIN TOMORROW WELL BEFORE FLOW AND TELL THEM WE ARE NOT TAKING THESE MW'S.
THEY SUPPOSEDLEY KNOW ABOUT THIS DEAL.
THEY ARE NOT TO GENERATE.
CUT DEAL # 849947 IN ENPOWER SCHEDULING AND REPLACE WITH PURCHASES UNDER ERCOT ASSET.
We will either purchase 100 mw's balday (well below $28.75) or take the pool price.
For the hours that are filled by the pool, I need a purchase from Ercot Imbalance (under Ercot Asset book), zero price and mk-mkt flag set to "no."
Obviously, the market will be short tomorro, especially in the morning.
Purchase at least some megawatts for tomorrow, but dont give away our position.
Maybe we could import from the East.
That would be great.
If you left us short for 100 mw's 12-22, that would be cool.
We can take care of that.
FRONTERA NEEDS TO BUY 50 mw for hour ending 2300 to cover Mirant sale for the last hour.
Purchase under the Teco Service book and sell to Frontera under Teco Services book.
In Portal, we would enter a purchase from X and we should balance against an existing Mirant sale for hour ending 2300

I have just received word from Ted Bland that no one has responded to this memo.
Please re-read the following memo and respond to Ted by July 31, 2000.
Thanks in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.
As you know the ENA OTC is actively working with the Analyst and Associate Program to develop greater talent flow into ENA.
We are presently working on a number of initiatives to improve how this is working and significantly improve communication flow and responsiveness.
However in this regard we also need you to help make sure we have clear lines of communication within ENA regarding A&A resource levels, performance, rotations and retention efforts.
In this regard we would like for each of you to take the lead for your groups needs and ensure that any requests, questions or concerns about A&A's in your area are passed through you to either Ted Bland (ENA Recuitment Team Lead - x35275) or Jana Giovannani (ENA liaison from the AA Program - x39233) or myself.
It is important that we are discerning about what we do with our A&A resources and plan carefully and accurately for our future needs, in this regard we need for you personally (or a senior member of your team who you may optionally delegate this task to) will take the time to review any A&A resource requests from your team before passing them onto us.
In addition, given the importance of these resources, we will be inviting you to a regular bi-monthly meeting to discuss ENA A&A matters.
We will confirm the first date in due course.
In the meantime if you would like to volunteer another senior member of your team to assume this reponsibility please supply their name as soon as possible.
Please call with any questions.

Hey Mom, I know you remember Uncle Mike's quotation from PopPop's funeral...A girl I know has it on her instant messenger with a little change, and I like her version a lot, too.
Hers is: "Work like you don't need the money, love like you've never been hurt, and dance like no one is watching."
Just something more to think about (as if we don't have enough!).
Love,

CPUC Delays QF Payment Vote Sources believe that the delay in the PUC vote on paying the QFs 15% of their undercollected debt is likely a result from both a concern about bankruptcy issues raised by issuing what could be seen as a "preference payment" to the QFs (the PUC does follow these issues out of necessity, given the current environment) and a lack of clarity regarding how to implement the 15% payment.
The delay was unsurprising and characteristic of how the PUC operates.
It is also noted that there are many claims on SoCal's and PG&E's cash flows currently.
Additionally, agreeing to pay 15% of debts to the QFs raises legal issues, in that the utilities would be paying debts to some creditors, but not others.
This could increase the likelihood of an involuntary bankruptcy filing against SoCal by the non-QF creditors.

The subject line of this email is hardly news.
How have companies toughed out past downturns and gone on to succeed?
What did it take in terms of leadership, strategy and execution for companies to continue growing and prosper in past downturns?
What were the key differentiators in sales and marketing, human resource and financing success?
As you know from the last email I sent you, the VentureWire Executive Summit on November 6 in San Jose plans to get the answers to these and many other questions.
We?ve called together a superb roster of speakers and panelists who have built companies in difficult times, and positioned them well to ride past upturns.
How will organizations need to be structured to be ready for when the current market rebounds?
Where is the money to be had until that rebound happens?
Our roster of speakers are supremely well-qualified to answer these and other pressing questions.

Last week FERC held a kickoff meeting on its Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANOPR) for interconnection procedures.
FERC staff proposes to have 6 weeks of meetings (up to 3 days per week) to discuss issues identified by the participants.
The purpose of the meetings is to try to develop consensus among industry participants on a standard interconnection agreement and procedures.
A list of issues is attached.
This list was developed by EPSA and presented to FERC at last week's meeting.
At this week's meeting, the discussion will focus on the scope of interconnection rights and on interconnection study issues.
Donna Fulton will attend these meetings on behalf of Enron.
In preparation for the meetings, EPSA developed a position paper, which is attached.
Briefly, EPSA proposes: - Interconnecting Generator may elect, as part of its application for interconnection and study agreement, to be studied as an Energy Resource and/or as a Network/Capacity Resource; it may also request an "optional deliverability" study based on case-specific requirements.
The interconnecting generator may elect its level of interconnection following completion of the studies.
- The rights of the interconnected generator will depend on the manner it is studied, the upgrades for which the generator has paid, and whether the transmission pricing system is based on physical rights or financial rights.
If you have any comments on the attached, please let me know as soon as possible.

Sandi and Dave and Mike will dicuss further on the call on Monday but wanted to disseminate info regarding the meeting that Joe Ronan of Calpine offered on an IEP call today: The meeting was attended by a lot of folks of all stripes.
Wright was very critical of how the Governor is handling the issue and wants to craft a solution with the industry and then invite the Governor to get on board.
Wright threw a whole laundry list of options on the table for folks to consider (Dave's typing up his notes from the meeting for distribution later today) One of Wright's key concern is forward contracting.
The utilities said that Loretta Lynch is the problem with the onerous "prudence" criteria she's imposing on utility forward contracts.
Those onerous criteria keep the utility from contracting.
Much discussion of what California does on the gas side, i.e., set an objective benchmark price; if the utility beats it, they profit; if they do worse, they take the hit.
The utility, under this framework, has broad flexibility to contract forward, i.e., PUC gets out of the way.
(FYI: Coincidentally, I suggested this approach in very broad terms--pointing to

Attached for your review and comment is a first draft of the WPTF motion to intervene and protest the WestConnect filing.
The major points made in it are as follows: ?
The Commission should convene a technical conference to deals with areas in the WestConnect filing that require further clarification, such as congestion management.
Moreover, the analysis of congestion management issues must focus on the equitable allocation of transmission rights; ?
The Commission should require WestConnect to establish an independent board, with an accompanying stakeholder process that complies with commission precedent; ?
All load should be required to take service under the WestConnect tariff; ?
Interconnection issues should be deferred until completion of the Commission's generic proceeding on this topic; and ?
Since a for-profit Transco has an inherent incentive to maximize transmission revenue, there are certain RTO functions that an entity such as WestConnect should not perform.
I am indebted to Karen Shea of Dynegy and Glenn Martin of Mirant for their very helpful assistance.
Our draft also draws upon concepts contained in the EPSA filing that Gary Ackerman provided.
The filing is due at FERC on Thursday the 15th.
I therefore need any comments from you no later than early that morning.
Thanks!

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.
Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.
Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.
On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant.
At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).
Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.
The following guidelines must be followed: ?
Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?
Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.
Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale.
?
Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.
Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.
?
Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises.
?
Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.
If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext.

Wade here are the wiring instructions for two payments, one to the CAISO and one to Calpine: CAISO: $206,000 This amount represents two days' A/S and GMC charges, plus enough money to bring replenish the "3-day buffer."
Calpine: $1,980,800 This represents two days' worth of energy to serve our California load.
Our price was $40/MWh.
By purchasing this energy from Calpine instead of the CAISO, we saved $120/MWh ($60/MWh + $100/MWh underscheduling penalty).
This is a savings of approximately $6 million over the next two days.

In this incredibly difficult time, giving to others may seem implausible, if not impossible.
It can, however, lighten our burden as we help others.

Enron Elves is an opportunity to provide gifts for children who would otherwise go without.
The official Enron Elves Tree has been erected and will soon be adorned with holiday gift tags.
Each gift tag contains a gift idea for a child.

Take a candy cane gift tag from the tree ?
Sign your name to one side of the folded gift tag and place the signed tag in the box by the tree ?
The other gift tag needs to come back attached to the wrapped gift ?
Bring the wrapped gift and place it under the tree All gifts need to be wrapped and under the tree by December 18.

Agustin, Per our discussion on Friday, I have changed this deal so that Enron is selling leg 1.
I can't remember.
Did you say that we have already received a check back from the counterparty?
Let me know, b/c this deal has price and basis and I'm sure the desk that had the basis risk wants the money owed them.
Thanks,

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.
We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.
Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.
Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.
These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee.
However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as "taxable" income.
Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as "imputed tax".
See example below Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee.
Subsidy for Bus Pass $100.00 Exclusion amount $ 65.00 Taxable Income amount $ 35.00

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.
You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM.
All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.
When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.
The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.
New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period.
Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels.
This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.
If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

This memo will be sent by Rick Causey via notes mail regarding an additional role that I will assume with regard to global operations.
I shared this in the staff meeting so that you would be the first to know.
I will still fulfill my role within ENA as VP of Energy Operations.
I will not be going away!
This expanded responsibility should create addtional opportunities for operations personnel and will validate some of the global functions that we already provide to the organization.

We met with Gov Davis on Thursday evening in LA.
In attendance were Ken Lay, the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.
The gov.
spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his ideas.
He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.
Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff Dasovich and I prepared.
Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation based on the governor's comments: Overview: We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing communication with his administration.
The gov does not want the utilities to go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.
His staff has more work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.
He talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail level.
He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power (which he estimates at 3000MW).
He foresees a mix of market oriented solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix the problem by '02 and provide some political cover.
Our proposals: I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also included the forward price information several of you provided).
He seemed interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate analysts and other "nonadvocates" to develop solutions to a number of issues including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.
He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas purchases.
As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding some state sponsored credit support for the utilities.
His ideas: The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously under serious consideration and some of which

Cinergy going into summer long on power Cinergy CEO Jim Rogers told Restructuring Today in a three-part interview that this summer prices will be low and electric supplies plentiful.
Is it the result of the June 1998 price spike that rose to $7,500?
Did the high price lure in generation that's now providing ECAR consumers with economical prices at a time when the West Coast is being punished for not doing the same?
"The short answer is yes," Rogers replied.
ECAR is getting 4,000 mw more capacity this summer, he added.

Special Greeting Subject: PRESIDENTIAL BUSH'S SPECIAL CHRISTMAS GREETING "Christmas is a time of wonder and joy, of generosity and peace, that brings family and friends together in celebration and song.
We sing old hymns and familiar carols, we show love for others in the giving of gifts, and we observe the hallowed traditions that make the season special.
This year in the midst of extraordinary times, our Nation has shown the world that though there is great evil, there is a greater good.
Americans have given of themselves, sacrificing to help others and showing the spirit of love and sharing that is so much a part of the Christmas season.
According to the Gospel of Luke, two thousand years ago, the savior of mankind came into the world.
Christians believe that Jesus' birth was the incarnation of God on earth, opening the door to new hope and eternal life.
At Christmastime, Christians celebrate God's love revealed to the world through Christ.
And the message of Jesus is one that all Americans can embrace this holiday season -- to love one another.

The 2002 Enron Net Works budget will for the first time combine allocations to business units for four key services: Enron Online, IT Infrastructure, Risk Management Operations and IT Maintenance and Development.
We are providing a level of detail for expense and capital spend that is greater than that provided in past years, and that will allow business units to make informed choices regarding the services that they receive.
We are meeting with individual business unit Offices of the Chair to review in detail the four service areas delivered through Enron Net Works.
Some of these meetings have been completed and more will occur between now and October 12.
Please keep the following points in mind as we work with you to finalize budget: Enron Networks today is very different from this time last year.
Additions to the 2002 ENW budget are Operations for EA, EIM and EGM.
Operations, IT Maintenance and Development, and IT Infrastructure for EES and EBS have been included under the ENW umbrella for the first time in the 2002 budget as well.
The 2001 budgets for these functions were approved and included in individual business units last year.
Any comparison of ENW's 2002 versus 2001 budget must be appropriately adjusted for these organizational changes to be relevant.
For further detail for each business unit, ENW's 2002 expense and capital dollars are organized to mirror each business unit's lines of business (products or commodities) in order to create a transparent view at a more granular level of the costs involved in supporting each of the lines of business.
The detail that is being provided to business units for IT costs delineates licensing fees, system maintenance costs and new development costs.
Detail on each IT development project identifies the purpose, business sponsor, line of business, "in progress" or "planned" designation, expense and capital spend, system impacted, and estimated completion date.
In order to finalize IT project budgets, decisions will be required from the business units on which projects to undertake in 2002.
If you have questions about the ENW budgets as we are working with you to finalize them, please call one of us.

 ⁇ MF May 31st 2001.pdf>> Good Thursday Morning - Comments From The Local Guys!
With the markets short-term overbought, investors should not be surprised if negative corporate news takes its toll on stocks over the next month.
As we have mentioned, the corporate confession period is a great time for companies to lower expectations.
However, investors need to be focused on the big picture.
The Federal Reserve is strongly on the side of the investor.
Additionally, with successful passage of the tax bill through Congress, the Treasury Department will be mailing refund checks to taxpayers, as the tax-cut is retroactive to January of this year.
We believe the economy will respond positively to this 'twin pronged' stimulation.
Investors should take advantage of any weakness in their favorite stocks.
We look forward to hearing from our readers.
Tomorrow, we look for another weak employment report for May.
Overall employment growth is expected to slip another 15,000, following a 223,000 decline in April.
The unemployment rate is projected to rise a tenth to 4.6%.
The 30-year US T-Bond yield is 5.77%.
.
The 5-year is trading at 4.94%.
Spot crude oil is trading at $28.39 p/b.
Natural Gas - Henry Hub - is trading at $3.92 p/mcf.
AD Time: New Federal Insider-Trading Rule (Rule 10b5-1) have been adopted by the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
This rule greatly enhances an insider's/employee's ability to trade his/her corporate shares during blackout periods.
Previously, without the protection of this new SEC rule, employees and insiders could safely trade only outside of designated blackout windows.
Under this new rule, insiders/employees may have the ability to purchase and sell their corporate shares even during blackout periods if a written plan was established and in force when the insider/employee was not in possession of material, non-public information.
The new rule contains other restrictions and should be reviewed carefully.

From time to time there have been discussions in the TIE list criticizing Con Edison for its involvement in out-of-merit actions, implying that it is inappropriate for Con Edison control room operators to make such requests.
In its recent order on the Revised Local Mitigation Measures, FERC, in response to allegations made by Orion, ordered the NYISO to take responsibility for out-of-merit.
The Con Edison system has the world's most concentrated use of energy for residential and commercial purposes.
It is also a highly transmission-constrained area where transfer limitations under normal and second contingency conditions require certain minimum generation levels within specific load pockets to assure reliability under existing reliability rules.
One of the main functions of the Con Edison control center is to be vigilant of system conditions at all times and prevent the system from reaching an unreliable operating state.
When such conditions are imminent, the Con Edison operator so advises the NYISO.
Some parties have said that Con Edison operators should never make out-of-merit requests.
Con Edison operators would be acting irresponsibly if they were to detect an imminent unreliable operating condition and just sit back and not inform the NYISO of the potential danger.
Con Edison operators have been trained to focus on operating the New York City system.
The NYISO operators have a much wider state-wide focus.
It is entirely appropriate for both a transmission owner (TO) and NYISO operators to work cooperatively in maintaining reliability with the clear understanding that under the FERC-approved tariff, it is the NYISO that has sole responsibility for reliability.
I would like to clarify that all involvement by Con Edison operators in out-of-merit actions are based on the following FERC-approved process in which the NYISO, and not the TO operator, has sole responsibility for these actions.
The NYISO FERC Electric Tariff, Section 5.4, Operations Under Adverse Conditions states in essence that: * The NYISO shall operate the system in accordance with Reliability Rules, including local rules * The NYISO will do this, among other measures, by adjusting generator output levels * The NYISO has sole responsibility for declaring that Adverse Conditions are imminent * Activation of these actions shall involve a two-step process 1.
The TO involved will advise the NYISO that an Adverse Condition is imminent and recommend action 2.
The NYISO activates the appropriate procedures * Records of the activation of such procedures shall be maintained by both the TO and the NYISO Having stated the above, let me also say that

As things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently.
Organizational Matters The Creditors' Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee.
This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees.
The Creditors' Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11.
Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections.
Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain.
From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun.
Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.
We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.
Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.
This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.
By now, you must have heard of "NETCO."
This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enron's most valuable business, the wholesale energy business.
Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership.
We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO.
It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO.
The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder.
We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January.
As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention.
This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors' Committee.
We will update you periodically on our process.
Personnel Matters As a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization.
Office of the Chairman - Enron Corp Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along

Sue- In lieu of my attendance in Austin, I want to know if you have any good books for me to read.
I'm gotten a list from Sam and from a friend at school, but I thought that you'd have some solid contributions.
A theory (for the Prince of Peacers): I debating the concept that we are a gigantic sociological experiment to God.
I'm thinking that individually God knows nothing about us, or cares for that matter.
I feel that when he gets tired of watching Jerry Springer re-runs, he looks down on our little planet form his lay-z-boy and selects one of us at random, throws a dose of adversity at us and watches how we handle it.
Gotta be more entertaining than watching fat half naked people air their dirty laundry on T.V.
Then again maybe not.

He has several questions regarding the base contract that they have with Enron, and EnronOnline.
For example, if their users logged into EOL under Coast Canada, and transacted on an US product, what underlying agreement would be governed?

If you could give them a call they would really appreciate it.

Here's the blow by blow: Tuesday a.m. Tony Walden (VNG) told Kay Khan (settlements coordinator for ENA) that he had the payment set up in their system to pay ENA $7,264,089.42, but that per Beth White, VP & Controller of AGL no payments were to be released to Enron.
Around 11:30 - Bryce Baxter contacted Beth White to find out what the issues were that would prevent payment.
Left message.
Tuesday p.m. Around 3:00 - Bryce Baxter called Beth White again and spoke with her secretary.
Her secretary said she would send Beth a text page and would call back as soon as possible, but haven't received return call yet.
Around 4:30 - Bryce Baxter called Beth again and left another message.
Kay Khan also called Tony Walden again and left another message, letting him know we hadn't received a call back from Beth White.

The Commercial Group asked several weeks ago whether they can enter into discount letters applicable to daily firm for as long as one year.
The standard wording of the discount letter applicable to daily firm is such that the discount is effective for as many one-day terms as the FTS-1 agreement renews, but not beyond a specified date.
Typically TW enters into these discount letters for a term of one month.
The marketers say that they were once told that they could not make such a discount applicable for longer than a 3-month term.
I see no basis for this limitation.
The term of the FTS-1 agreement is one day, renewable from day to day.
The discount is only applicable for so long as the FTS-1 agreement renews.
If the FTS-1 agreement does not renew, the discount is no longer applicable.
The basis for the shipper's transportation rights is the FTS-1 agreement.
We are not guaranteeing a shipper "daily" firm for longer than a one-day term.
The discount letter merely states that, for so long as the FTS-1 agreement renews, a particular discount applies, up to a certain cutoff date.
Does this make sense?
I realize you are swamped, but I need to get Steve an answer so that the marketers know what is acceptable.
Drew and I have discussed this and he is on board.
Thanks.

Anyway, I was just wondering what plans you have in the next month or so because I want to go someplace and do something, but I'm just not sure what yet.
I have a bunch of vacation I need to take and I'd rather not sit around here and twidle my thumbs.
Let me know if you have any suggestions.

When you download MP3 files you should download them in 128 kps format.
That is CD quality sound and you can get about 30 minutes of music on 32MB of memory on an MP3 player.
You can sort by that format on Napster.

The lawsuit was filed at 11:06 a.m.
The next thing to do is to get MSN formally served.
To do that, we have to get citation issued (we are working with the court personnel to expedite this process) and serve the papers on MSN's registered agent in Austin.
We are trying to do that as quickly as possible -- hopefully, by the end of the day.
Please do not mention the lawsuit to MSN until I notify you that formal service has been accomplished.

Sean, thank you for your rent deposit yesterday.
I really appreciate your timeliness.
I will be in Portland Sat Jan 26 to Wed Jan 30 for business reasons.
I need to have an electrician install smoke detectors per the new code effective the first of January + I want to get the phone jack fixed in the guest bedroom.
I also need to meet with the landscaper about pruning the back hedge.
I'll be up to my ears in business meetings all day Monday and Tuesday morning.
I was thinking about making appointments for the electrician and the landscaper for Tuesday afternoon.
I will be there to let them know what I need to have done so I can give them access.
Is that ok with you?
Is there anything else that needs attention?
Hope life isn't too crazy for you with all the press Enron is getting these days.

Hey Gerald, I was talking with Kenny Smith about LRC, and the people associated with HPL that went over with AEP, when I thought of a certain facility planner.
I looked at the Enron directory, and found that you were still with Enron.
I presume you're still with ENA.
Are you still working contracts with them?
I had a chance to speak with Kevin Kuehler a few months ago, and according to him AEP is busy relooking at all kind of possibilities (old estimates).
I don't know how long that kind of enthusiasm will last.
AEP will probably find out (what ENA already knew) how hard it is to make some good margins.
Let me know how things are with you these days.

Assume the confirm is governed by Texas law.
Most counterparties sign the confirm and fax it back to us WITHOUT the attached Annex A.
Is this sufficient under Texas law as having received the "executed" confirmation?
Do we need to modify our language incorporating the Annex A?

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.
In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.
Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.
He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.
Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.
Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets.
He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.
Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.
In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.
I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.
I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.
Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.
But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.
The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.
Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors.
His resignation is effective immediately.

Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal."
He added, "My concern is for current and former Enron employees and other stakeholders, and I feel that it is in their best interest for me to step down from the Board."

Dear Family, Please see the attached schedules for preseason and regular games for the Houston Rockets through November.
Because we all have very busy lives and find it impossible to confirm too far in advance, I will wait closer to each game before distributing tickets.
Also, Ken's schedule is a moving target and it would make it much easier for him to squeeze in at least one game this year, if we could do it on shorter notice.
Our eight basketball seats are amazing and the tickets are a hot item, so hopefully everyone will try to make this work and have fun doing it.
I will wait at least seven days before each game to distribute the tickets.
If you have any interest in pre-selecting certain games that you definitely want to attend, please advise me and I will put your name on the list with an * next to it.
Additionally, if you think you know your schedule and would like to be considered in the ticket distribution for certain games, I will put your name on the list with a ?
next to your name.
Once your name is on the list and as each game gets closer, I would appreciate it if you would contact me ASAP when you find out that you are unable to attend.
Everyone has said that they want to be fair and rotate, so that each family member has a shot at attending a game and getting both kinds of tickets.
Hopefully, we can all work it out.
However, in the event that we have more requests than tickets for the same game, and we are unable to settle it, I will have Barb pull names out of a hat.
Once you confirm your attendance, tickets can be put in an envelope with your name on them and sent down to the doorman at the Huntingdon for you to pick up.
For any games where our immediate family is not able to use the tickets, they will be distributed to other lucky recipients in a rotating order.
I will have Barb draw your names and ours out of a hat to create the rotation.
If you have other family members or someone special that you would like to offer tickets to, let me know.
I can either contact you and have you contact them or you can give me their names and contact information and Barb will contact them directly, as you wish.
In the event that I am traveling or cannot be reached, please contact Barb as she will be copied in on all current schedules and have access to the tickets.
GO ROCKETS!
Love, Mom

Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.
Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.
We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.
While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.
The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.
It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.
We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.
Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.
Ken Dear ETS Colleague: On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.
The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.
In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.
Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.
The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.
For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.
Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.
Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.
Keep up the good work!
Stan

Just in case anyone had any doubts about how Davis is approaching the issue...... Davis announces four new energy advisors Updated: May 18, 2001 - 2:54 p.m. Gov.
Gray Davis has added four new advisers to his energy staff, including members of former Vice President Al Gore's staff and campaign team.
Chris Lehane, former Gore press secretary, and Mark Fabiani, a deputy campaign manager for the Gore-Lieberman presidential run, will coordinate the governor's communications staff on energy issues and help recruit a new director of communications.
Lehane and Fabiani's company will earn $30,000 per month for six months.
Nancy McFadden, former deputy chief of staff to Gore, will earn $118,000 a year as a senior adviser to the governor, said Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman.
McFadden will concentrate on the governor's relations with federal regulators and with generators.
Davis also has recruited Kellan Fluckiger, chief operations officer for the Independent System Operator, keeper of the state's power grid.
Fluckiger is "on loan" from the ISO, and will work with energy suppliers, Maviglio said.

They stated that the deal guys are acting like EE&CC is a done deal.

I attended the FERC Commission meeting this morning and it was short and refreshing.
Here are some high points: FERC issues an order rejecting the proposed amendment to the CAISO creditworthiness provisions, and granting in part the complaint of the generators in the docket (which we supported).
The CAISO is ordered to enforce the existing creditworthiness provisions of its tariff and invoice CDWR for transactions with the non-creditworthy IOUs, within 15 days.
Otherwise, FERC will seek injunctive relief in court to enforce its order.
Also, a creditworthy party must be provided and bills paid, otherwise, the must offer requirement will be suspended (applies to California).
Commissioner Massey dissented on the suspension of the must offer requirement.
Wood indicated that he supported the order as written and quipped that "the ISO must now do what we told them to do the 3rd time!"
The remaining Commissioners voted in favor.
Unanimous vote on a 6-page order which establishes the FERC "business plan" on how it will move forward on RTO's, electricity market design and structure, so that faster progress can be made.
Watch for a future order relaxing the FERC's ex parte rules to facilitate communication between FERC and state commissioners.
The idea is that communications will be more freely made and that a transcript of the communication will be filed in the record of the proceeding to comply with due process and other legal requirements.
I gathered the above from the discussions held at the meeting as the draft orders are not yet available.
We will review them upon receipt, and update this e-mail if necessary.

In an effort to better organize the activities and minimize the expenses related to the Chapter 11 filing, we have formed the Bankruptcy Management Committee.
There are many outside firms representing multiple parties that will be requesting, among other things, certain tasks to be performed, filings with the bankruptcy court, financial analysis and general business information.
To ensure these activities are coordinated, the Bankruptcy Management Committee will now be responsible for overseeing this process.
The following is a list of some of the parties that may contact you directly.
If anyone from these firms, or other firms, contacts you related to the bankruptcy, please notify a member of the committee to ensure the efforts are coordinated.
All outside firms will be requested to notify a member of the committee prior to contacting other Enron personnel or outside parties, including the court and Creditors' Committee.
Firm Relationship Bankruptcy court (i.e.
motions, etc.)

As things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently.
Organizational Matters The Creditors' Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee.
This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees.
The Creditors' Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11.
Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections.
Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain.
From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun.
Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.
We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.
Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.
This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.
By now, you must have heard of "NETCO."
This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enron's most valuable business, the wholesale energy business.
Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership.
We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO.
It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO.
The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder.
We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January.
As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention.
This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors' Committee.
We will update you periodically on our process.
Personnel Matters As a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization.
Office of the Chairman - Enron Corp Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along

It would also be another linkage into the SAmerican business from Houston to help monitor and defray technical and development risk.

Jeff, I needed to apologize for my inability to handle myself in more of a professional manner.
I thought I had moved on from being an emotional basket case , but as we found out, I haven't.. Again , please accept my apology.
I just need to move forward and stop reflecting on the past.
It is so difficult when you have given your entire career for an organization that still doesn't see value in you.
But, that is my problem not yours.
In regards to your party , your right, I laughed at the invitation - (It is so Shankman) - Sorry I will not be able to attend.
But thanks for asking.
And lastly, Wes Walton how?

Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.
The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29: ?
Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.
The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.
?
After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.
As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.
?
The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.
Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.
This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.
These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.
To move funds: On the Web, choose "Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation" from the drop down menu.

Hey Guys - Well, I had to learn some Cod Scheduling fast this afternoon, (we really do need to exchange new cell phone numbers :-)).
Anyway, tag #40700 was incorrect and BPA called about 3:45.
I cancelled that tag and replaced it with tag #40716 I hope what I did was okay, let me know if I should have done it differently.
On the NW sheet that tag number is highlighted in yellow in case there is a problem.
I assume the something needs to be corrected in the preschedule workspace, but I don't know what it is, so I will leave it to Cara or Donald to explain it to me in the morning.
Thanks again, Serena

Clem, Attached is the resume of my dear friend, Carolyn Varela.
Carolyn started working at Liddell, Sapp, Zivley, Hill & LaBoon a few months before I did in 1984 (while I left after 10 years for the greener pastures of Enron!).
Before coming to Liddell, Sapp, Carolyn was a Corporate Paralegal at Texas Commerce Bank, one of the principal clients of Liddell, Sapp, and was a key contact for handling the TCB relationship over the years along with the primary lawyer she worked for, Mr. LaBoon, who maintained the TCB relationship for the law firm.
Carolyn is a kind, cheerful person, a hard worker and a pleasure to be around.
I was in the Municipal Bond Group and she was in the Corporate Group, but we frequently backed each other up (as well as the Real Estate and Lending teams) on closings, proofreading documents, large filings, etc.
I think she would be a great asset to your team and Enron.

USA: INTERVIEW-EnronOnline sees volume growth, CEO says.
By Gelu Sulugiuc 07/17/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, July 17 (Reuters) - As most players in a shrinking pool of online energy trading platforms struggle to stay alive, leader EnronOnline has a simple philosophy: If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
The Internet arm of the energy marketing and trading giant Enron Corp. , EnronOnline predicts it will increase its volume and says it can coexist with the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), the chief executive of Enron Networks told Reuters on Tuesday.
The innovative company is always evaluating its business environment, ready to remold itself according to market demands, but it is not pursuing mergers or aquisitions for now, according to Greg Piper.
"I would never say never, but we're not proactively looking at aquiring an ownership position in any other exchange platform," Piper said.
With an average of $3.5 billion in trades every day, EnronOnline enjoys the highest volume of all energy electronic platforms.
Most energy trading platforms launched last year have failed to generate profits.
Its closest rival is ICE, which routinely exceeds $1 billion a day.
But while ICE is a many-to-many exchange that matches bids and offers, on EnronOnline one can only trade with Enron.
"It's a tool that supercharges our market-making business," Piper said.
Enron is the No.
1 natural gas and electricity marketer in the United States.
About 60 percent of its transactions are captured through the electronic platform.
"As long as we show good prices to our customers, our volumes will continue to grow," Piper said.
The company is looking to grow online volume in products such as metals, steel, weather, petrochemicals and plastics.
"We're trying to remain the leader in energy and help our other markets get more traction," Piper said.
"There is a huge amount of growth that we haven't even tapped into yet."
Piper said he is not worried about ICE's recent success.
The Atlanta-based exchange recently took over London's International Petroleum Exchange and plans to transfer its open-outcry business online, significantly boosting its trade volumes.
"Maybe six to 12 months from now, the story might be a lot different," Piper said.
"But right now, there is room for the both of us."

A final word on the new DMS procedure.
Mike feels it's important you know that Volume Management will thoroughly research each discrepancy before bringing it to your attention.
"Make sure they understand that we will exhaust all of our efforts before we send it over to them.
All notes will be provided on the DMS telling them where we are and what we found out and where they should look," says Purcell.
So when the discrepancy shows up in your file, which you will check at the beginning of each shift, it is there because our back office professionals have hit an impasse and require your assistance to get through it.
That means it's important.

Awesome day.
Not a single cloud in the sky.
About 70 degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome.
We're on the second floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like wildmen.
The band doubles back to the street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of Texas.
AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome.
Again, we hoot and holler like wildmen.
Again, the band doubles back and stops right below us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs.
Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the "Traveler" and 11 cans of beer into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans.

To all of you who are without the luxury of a dial tone this morning: Qwest Communications is working on the malfunctioning phone circuit.
We don't know when the service will be reinstated; but in the meantime you can reflect on what life was like before the darn thing was invented.
Bell, Alexander Graham b. , March 3, 1847, Edinburgh d. Aug. 2, 1922, Beinn Bhreagh, Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Can.
Scottish-born American audiologist best known as the inventor of the telephone (1876).
For two generations his family had been recognized as leading authorities in elocution and speech correction, with Alexander Melville Bell's Standard Elocutionist passing through nearly 200 editions in English.
Young Bell and his two brothers were trained to continue the family profession.
His early achievements on behalf of the deaf and his invention of the telephone before his 30th birthday bear testimony to the thoroughness of his training.
Alexander ("Graham" was not added until he was 11) was the second of the three sons of Alexander Melville Bell and Eliza Grace Symonds Bell.
Apart from one year at a private school, two years at Edinburgh's Royal High School (from which he was graduated at 14), and attendance at a few lectures at Edinburgh University and at University College in London, Bell was largely family trained and self-taught.
His first professional post was at Mr. Skinner's school in Elgin, County Moray, where he instructed the children in both music and elocution.
In 1864 he became a resident master in Elgin's Weston House Academy, where he conducted his first studies in sound.
Appropriately, Bell had begun professionally as he would continue through life--as a teacher-scientist.

Here is what we have decided to do: 1.
As a condition to our execution of this Consent, we will execute an amendment to the existing Master with Morgan to (a) insert collateral provisions and (b) clean up some of the defined terms in the MEGA confirms.
I will draft the amendment and Christian will help you and Melissa develop the language for the amendment that deals with the confirm clean-up.
2.
We need to know from MEGA and Morgan what the transfer effective date is that establishes the cutoff date for these trades as between ourselves and each of Morgan and MEGA.
My revised draft of the Consent makes it clearer how this cutoff date works.

Dear Ken, I wrote you some time back about the campaign to raise ca.
$4 million to replace the American Heart Association's Houston regional headquarters building which burned this past April.
You were so kind in putting us in touch with Cindy Olson and Misha Siegel to discuss Enron's corporate position and the potential for assistance from the Ken and Linda Lay Foundation.
We deeply appreciated our meeting with Cindy and Misha.
Things have been progressing I'm pleased to say.
AHA has concluded a deal to sell the restored old building for approximately $1.15 million, and we have received substantial commitments from a very few individuals and Houston area foundations totaling approximately $600,000.
Therefore, our remaining challenge is to raise around $2-$2.25 million to complete the funding of a new building that will meet the needs of AHA in the years to come.
We have not yet been able to identify a very visible corporate or professional lead for the effort.
We will be discussing this possibility with Ernie Cockrell on November 6th.
As part of that conversation we would like to indicate notable leaders in Houston who would be willing to have their names affiliated with the capital campaign, perhaps as an Executive Committee or Advisory Committee.
The question to you is: Would you approve the use of your name in your capacity at Enron and/or the name of the Ken and Linda Lay Foundation in this way?
Again, the AHA and I have been so deeply appreciative of your willingness to support the American Heart Association for so many years.
I hope we can call on you for this additional assistance at a time of need.
Thanks, Ken, for your consideration.
Best regards,

Paul: Attached are the most current PJM transmission recon reports for November business ($21K worth of transmission not accounted for).
As we have discussed, there are a lot of outstanding issues for November and that it is important that it be reconciled in order to charge the requests to the respective trade desk.
I know there has been some moving around where responsibilities have shifted in your group and that you have had some things going on that have occupied your time, all which have impacted this reconciliation process.
I have tied together what I could with the information that was provided but will need more help from you to work toward getting this completed.
It will be easier for your group as well as ours to get this fixed before the current month ends rather than after the fact which leaves the remainder of this week.

Hi Kathy, Here are my suggestions/comments on Rev.
6 Definitions.
I think we need a Business Day definition, and a search and replace of business days for Business Days.
1.55 The definition of Performance Tests is really a definition of performance test reports.
I think we need a definition that incorporates the tests listed on Exhibit E. The phrase installation option is used, but I didn't find a description of the installation option when I did a search.
3.14.2.1 Is 6 months enough under this circumstances?
Does it matter?
4.3 Delete "Each".
5.1 The amounts on Exhibit N don't match what I have on the last option agreement, and there isn't a description of any options, unless I'm interpretting it incorrectly.
5.3 (ii) add "as provided in Section 5.5" 6.4 I may have missed this, but I didn't see where amounts owed by Seller would be charged interest if not timely paid.
10.7 Are the roman numerals correct?.
I am going to email you some new language for assignment and the buy back option.
You should have it today.
Do you have a redline on this rev 6 versus whatever the version was I read before?

This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals.
The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee, ANR and Columbia had done.
These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates, but FERC has decided that there is "significant potential for undue discrimination" and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative.
Thus, anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly rate-related will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny.
FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATED-RATE AUTHORITY Acting on a series of contract-specific cases, FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is, and is not, allowed under negotiated rates.
In further defining its policy, the commission continued to lean heavily on the "linchpin" of negotiated-rate authority - that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under cost-based recourse rates.
During discussion of the orders, Chairman Pat Wood III said it was "important to keep in mind, as we rush into the brave new world on the gas side," that "all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory basis by pipelines."
Last week's proclamation should be considered "a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory trend," he asserted.
In representative language, the commission said it wants to ensure that parties "are clear about contracting practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk" of such unequal treatment.
FERC declared that a "key factor" in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an "appropriate material deviation" from a pipeline's filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates provide "adequate alternatives" to other shippers.
In cases involving rates negotiated by ANR Pipeline Co. (GT01-25, RP99-301), Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. (RP96-312, et al.)
and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. (CP01-70), the commission ruled that the buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines' generally available tariffs.
The provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to the end of the deals.
While the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a negotiated-rate package, "we have reconsidered that holding" because similar buyout opportunities are not available to more traditional

Kathryn Corbally (Senior Director currently in Investor Relations) is moving to Connecticut soon to join her husband.
He has been working up there for the last six or eight months - he was one of the group that defected from our weather derivatives team about a year ago.
She hopes to continue to work for Enron - has been talking with Investor Relations and some other groups that I can't remember - and to do so either out of her home or in Enron's New York office.
It struck me that depending upon needs at MG's New York office, that Kathryn could be someone for you to consider.
She came originally from the London office - you may or may not find anyone still there that could give you some feedback on her.
In London, she ran mid and back office - that was in very early days for EEL, so most of the job was probably accounting.
She came to Houston and has done a number of different things.
I think that she is well organized and control minded.
Understands Enron's business.
Managing a group of people is probably not her strongest attribute.
I am not sure that people enjoy working under her.
That could be old news, however.
There are a number of people here in Houston that could probably give you a read on her based on very recent experience.
Do you know of her?
Just thought that I would mention her as a potential resource in New York.
Don't know what your short and longer term needs are there.
She would definitely represent an Enron point of view.
They have two small daughters - she might be interested in something part time even.
Could mean lower cost that way.
This idea may not have any merit or you may not have a need around metals.
If you do want to consider this, I will be glad to help identify who you could go to for some fact finding around her.
Let me know.

The NYISO apologizes for any inconvenience resulting in the delay in posting these invoices.
Transmission Customers will observe adjustments to their settlements to: (1) recover costs related to adjustments made outside of the billing process; (2) adjust regulation penalty charges to zero for suppliers; and (3) adjust the NYISO clearing account balance to zero for December 1999 settlements.
With regard to the adjustments made outside of the billing process, these adjustments could not have been corrected by a billing code or determinant data fix.
As a result, the mechanism of paying and funding the adjustments is done outside of the billing process.
The total adjustment of $581,563.37 was allocated across 13,147,961 MWh.
Customers may validate their respective adjustments by computing their ratio shares of the $581,563.37 using 5,059,790 MWh as the denominator in their respective ratios of their December 1999 load.
Customers will observe a difference in the denominators used in the ratio share allocation of this adjustment versus adjustment #3.
This is due to the fact that the costs for adjustment #1 are not allocated to those that received payment through the adjustment, which would defeat the purpose of the adjustment.
Prior to October 2000, the NYISO recovered or refunded differences in the revenue received from Schedule 1 charges, which were comprised of forecasted uplift & residual adjustments, and the costs actually incurred by adjusting subsequent month's Schedule 1 rates accordingly.
In October 2000, the NYISO implemented a change in the tariffed Schedule 1 provisions that allowed the recovery and refund of these costs as they were incurred.
In order to allow any changes in uplift and residual adjustments to be settled through the settlement adjustment process, the code implemented in October 2000 was used to report these costs to the market.
This results in an over-collection which is being returned to Customers through an adjustment to their monthly balances.
This billing treatment for the December 1999 settlement adjustments resulted in credits to the market totaling $5,219,402.09 allocated across 13,191,237 MWh.
Customers where allocated their portion of adjustment #3 above, based upon their respective ratio shares of the 13,191,237 MWh of NYISO transmission service billed for the month.
December 1999 settlement adjustment settlement dates have been changed to address the delay in invoicing.
Payments due to the NYISO for December 1999 settlement adjustments are due to be received in the NYISO clearing account on Monday, October 15, 2001.

I talked with Julie Smith right after lunch about ENA responding to Tennessee's South Texas Expansion.
The deadline to submit a response is this afternoon at 5:00 pm with the understanding that a binding precedent agreement with termination outs needs to be executed by tomorrow afternoon (i.e.
Thursday, November 29th).
I told Julie that I thought it was best if ENEL, rather than ENA, submitted the open season response and signed Tennessee's PA. That way ENEL's RFP response would not get snarled up with any credit concerns that Tennessee had with the Enron Corp. announcements.
I told her that we were still an on-going concern and still wanted to sell gas to the project.
She appreciated our honesty and reaffirmed that ENEL was still interested in entering into a fuel supply arrangement with ENA.
Also, I just received an announcement from Rio Bravo Pipeline that said that "due to the CFE changing the date on which the bidders must present their Bid Proposals for the Rio Bravo IV Project from December 4, 2001 to December 11, 2001" that the Rio Bravo Pipeline Open Season was also being pushed back to December 7, 2001.
So it looks like ENEL has about another week to work on their proposal.
Ruth P.S.
I just got off the phone with Tennessee Gas Pipeline to thank them for extending the Open Season for us and give him an update on participating in the expansion.
He indicated that "another international company" had just submitted an Open Season response.
So it looks like ENEL has submitted the necessary paperwork.

Part II: FERC Writing Handbook 1.
"WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED" adds a note of authority to your pleadings.
In fact, some administrative law judges will throw your pleading into the special incinerator marked "Nonconforming Pleadings" (located on the west side of the FERC building) unless such language is present.
2.
Pronouns should be used sparingly, if at all.
With few exceptions, parties must always be named to avoid confusion, even if it means the name of the party will appear several times in one sentence.
3.
The verb "request" may not be used without the word "to."
Example: "Pipeline X respectfully requests the Commission to grant its motion."
4.
"In regards to" or "vis-a-via" sound more intelligent than "about" or "concerning."
5.
If you are not sure you've conveyed an important point effectively, repeat the statement verbatim at various other points in your pleading for emphasis.
Additionally, repeating a contractual provision several times in a contract will give your client greater rights than if you only include the provision once.
6.
Always recite the entire history of the proceeding in your pleading before stating the purpose of your pleading.
No FERC staffer ever remembers what happens, and the added pages will make your pleading really impressive.
7.
When in doubt, insert more commas.

Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.
Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.
We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.
While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.
The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.
It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.
We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.
Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.
Ken Dear ETS Colleague: On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.
The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.
In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.
Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.
The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.
For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.
Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.
Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.
Keep up the good work!
Stan

Enron and Dynegy each announced today that they are holding discussions about a possible merger of the two companies.
As you know, Dynegy is a major player in the energy marketplace, and is not only a competitor, but also a counterparty of Enron.
This is just one of several options that we are considering.
Upon receipt of this announcement, the NYSE briefly suspended trading of both Enron and Dynegy.

On October 31, 2001, the NYISO web servers will be upgraded.
This will require both software and hardware changes.
While these changes will be transparent to the users, these changes will require that the MIS system be unavailable for approximately 60 minutes.
The outage will begin at approximately 11:35 AM.
Market Participants planning on submitting HAM transactions or modifying Day Ahead bids should act accordingly.
The NYISO will minimize the duration of the outage as much as possible as we recognize the inconvenience caused by system outages.
Ultimately, these changes will result in a more stable environment and provide enhanced services that the current web servers are unable to perform.

Dear Jason Wolfe, It has been a while since we spoke about your driving needs.
Our inventory has changed since then and I realize your needs may have changed as well.
We can still have the vehicle you originally were interested in within 24 hours and we also have some that are similar with similar equipment, only less expensive.
Toyota has special financing rates available on Corollas, Tundras, 4Runners and 2001 Siennas.
We have great deals on 2002 Camrys.
If youd like to revisit our inventory, please click here www.smccalltoyota.com I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Regards,

Sara: I spoke with Mark about this and he was all in favor of having a party for Marie although I got the feeling that if we wait on him to organize it it won't happen.
Anyway, would you consider having a get together at your house?
We were just going to limit it to the swap group.
Let me know what you think.

All - I talked to Zhiyong Wei, who works for Jeff Johnson, and John Lavorato.
It sounds like there are a few issues that need to be resolved.
1.
Apparently it has been decided that someone (?)
from UBS will be providing a curve beginning on day 1.
That person has yet to be identified.
2.
There will have to be a daily interpolation of the curve into ERMS on a daily basis.
This presents a couple of problems.
Someone must approve the interpolation, and the official curve does not come out until 5:00 P.M. Central Time.
This means that after the interpolation and system load, it would probably be somewhere north of 6:00 PM before we could start our nightly process.
A difficult sell to say the least.
3.
There are offers out to two interest rate traders in Houston, but we still have not determined whom we will be working with from a Houston perspective.
Hopefully, decisions will be made by Monday.
Are you guys aware if there is a preliminary curve that we can use that comes out a bit earlier, and we can just have finance run with the official curve the next day?
Bottom Line : It sounds like they have worked out a process, but not necessarily a great one.
Jeff

Gloria, I need to have a redline generated by Comparwrite, as I don't have it loaded locally.
The original document is in my Fuel Cell/Equipment contract file, and has the same name as the one below, only it is dated October11 (I believe rev 2).
The new document is the one below.
Please save the redline verision in the same directory, and email the redlined document to me, Heather Kroll, Scott Healy, and Stephen Plauche ASAP.
Thanks,

How are things going?
Haven't talked to you in a while.
As for me, I am fine.
Work is pretty busy right now.
We are at the end of the quarter and have to get certain deals closed before March 31, so it can get hectic.
My roommate will be leaving shortly.
He got a job opportunity with his family in North Carolina, so he will be moving.
Didn't last very long, but I knew that was a possibility when he moved in.
Are you guys getting into the wedding planning mode now with Sharon.
It should really be a beautiful wedding up in Estes Park.
Very nice mountain scenery.
Take care and I will talk with you later.
Gerald.

I'm looking at the GDP-HEHUB curve shift details, and it has a current price of 0, and prior price of 4.151 for August.
Position manager's getting this from the deal aggregator, which grabs it from ERMS.
It appears to be using the mid price off of deals.
So if we look at post ID 1159936, deal Q29897.2, we have GDP-HEHUB for the pub code, and 4.151 as the mid price for August.
My question for you fine gentlemen is, where should it be pulling the prior day curve value?
Should I just hit egs_curves, and insert the value from there?

As you know, the Enron Management Conference will be held Wednesday through Friday, November 14-16, 2001, at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio, Texas.
This has been an eventful and challenging year for Enron.
Now, more than ever, it is fitting to bring Enron's leaders together.
After all, it is up to our management team to lead our company through these challenging times.
Together, we will define Enron's character and determine Enron's destiny.
We have a great program planned for this year's conference.
I'm delighted that General Norman Schwarzkopf will join us as a keynote speaker on leadership.
I'm equally pleased to welcome back Gary Hamel, who will help us process the past year and prepare for future success.
As I've said before, we are a company that continues to look to the future, and there are many exciting things in store for us.
I look forward to seeing you at this very important meeting.
Regards,

Randy, Scott Healy contacted Bob Kelly at Calpine about Calpine's potential interest in Bridgeline and he found that Kelly and Cartwright had no real knowledge of the potential deal.
Likely this originates at the local level and is probably a long put.
Kelly was going to get back to Scott with more detail over the next week.

Energy Committee Members: We have been offered an opportunity to benefit from a unique federal funding program.
Sure Power has been funded to implement distributed generation (DG) into a high-availability, energy-intensive application in the data communications industry (i.e.
telecom hotel, financial processing center, internet data center, etc.).
As you know, Sure Power is the world's leading supplier of DG-based systems providing six 9's availability (certified by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology).
Sure Power's patented technology eliminates interconnection issues with the utility, which has been one of the technical inhibitors to widespread adoption of DG.
Sure Power has already aligned themselves with EPRI to assist them with measurement and analysis, but are looking for a partner who has a potential project on the horizon that could benefit from Sure Power's technology and federal funding assistance (as much as $3M).
Please note, the project does not have to be past the internal approval stage to benefit.
Even a potential project that is still being analyzed for viability could receive funding for an initial feasibility study.
Understanding that the high-tech industry is going through trying times, and that many projects have been put on hold; Sure Power has a three-year window in which to apply the funds, so even a project that may not start for eighteen months would work.
The deadline in which to finalize their project package is September 12, so Sure Power would need to have a response from a potential partner no later than COB Tuesday September 4.
Feel free to contact Sure Power directly with any questions.

As presently drafted the ETA provides that if a master agreement is in force covering a particular transaction, the master controls.
I don't think we ever adequately resolved the multiple Enron entity issue, though.
For example, if a counterparty has an ISDA Master Agreement in place with ENA, that master agreement could easily cover a trade based on UK gas prices.
However, it is not the commercial people's intent that the system work that way.
They want every trade for a particular product to be with a single Enron entity (e.g.
all UK gas transactions are with Enron Europe), regardless of what master agreements are in place.
To resolve this I suggest that the long descriptions be revised to state the Enron trading entity for each product type (this is already in place for European derivatives) and that the ETA be revised as follows: revise the fifth line of paragraph (a) of Section 3 such that Transactions are governed by the short and long definitions in respect of a product "...and any master agreement between Counterparty and the Enron entity trading in such product on the Website which is in effect as of the date of the execution of such Transaction..." (underlined text inserted) I think this will please the commercial and tax people; any thoughts from the legal side?

Mark, Business Controls, which includes Corporate Security at Enron Corp, would like to conduct a security survey of Enron's offices in Denver.
I am tentatively planning on travel to Denver 10/18-10/19.
If I could impose on you to provide some information about the office it would help greatly in my planning.
In particular, could you briefly describe the office(s); location, which floor, how large, how many employees, and any other Enron subsidiaries or offices in Denver.
Additionally, would you be my point of contact, or can you designate someone?
Lastly, if the above dates do not work for you, please feel free to suggest alternates.
Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter.

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.
These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee.
However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as "taxable" income.
Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as "imputed tax".
See example below Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee.
Subsidy for Bus Pass $100.00 Exclusion amount $ 65.00 Taxable Income amount $ 35.00
